<h3 title="I. “Young Lochinvar has come out of the west.”"
 >CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p class="chaphead">“YOUNG LOCHINVAR HAS COME OUT OF THE
WEST.”</p>


<p>There was an expression of sullen discontent upon
the handsome features of Mr. Harold Vreeland (gentleman
unattached), as the inbound Hudson River
train dashed along under the castled cliffs of Rhinebeck.</p>

<p>The afternoon was fair—the river of all rivers
glittered gaily in the sun, and a dreamy peace rested on
field and stream. But, the peace of this June afternoon
of ’95 entered not into the young wayfarer’s soul.</p>

<p>The five years which the traveler from nowhere in
particular had thrown away in the far wilds of the
sporadic West had not yet robbed his chiseled features
of the good looks which he had borne away from old
Nassau.</p>

<p>And, though his glittering blue eye had been
trained to a habitual impassiveness by much frontier
poker, he had always abjured that Rocky Mountain
whisky which “biteth like an adder.”</p>

<p>As he restlessly sought the smoking-car, after a
<a id="png.008" href="#png.008"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>vain struggle with the all too-evident immorality of a
saucy French novel, several quickly thrilled spinsters
followed his retreating form with warm glances of
furtive admiration and half-suppressed sighs.</p>

<p>Vreeland’s stalwart figure was clearly reminiscent
of well-played football and long straining at the oar.
His well-set head was bravely carried, his eye was
searching and even audaciously daring in its social
explorations.</p>

<p>At twenty-seven he had not lost the fascination of
his soft and perfectly modulated voice nor the winning
insinuation of his too frequent smile. The chin was
far too softly molded for an ascetic, and an expression
of lurking insincerity flickered in the pleasure-loving
curves of his handsome mouth.</p>

<p>But, shapely and glowing with manly vigor, he was
a very “proper man-at-arms” in the battle of life,
his sweeping cavalry mustache lending an air of
decision to his sun-burned features.</p>

<p>Though he was perfectly dressed up to the memories
of his never-forgotten “varsity” grade, the “wanderjahre”
had given to him a little of that easy swing
which is the gift of wandering on boundless prairies,
long nights spent <i lang="it">al fresco</i> under the glittering dome
of stars, and a close commune with the sighing pines
of the West.</p>

<p>The shade of bitterness deepened upon his moody
face as he noted a three-masted steam yacht swinging
along up the river, with the elastic quivering throb of
her quadruple compounded engines. This queenly
vessel bore the private signal of one American citizen
whose personal finances beggar the resources of many
modern kings.</p>

<p>“Those are the cold-hearted fellows who rule
<a id="png.009" href="#png.009"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>7<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>America now with a rod of iron—the new money
kings,” he growled. “Royal by the clink of the
dollar, sovereign by the magic wand of monopoly,
impregnable with the adamantine armor of trusts!”</p>

<p>And then, a lively hatred of the social grandees
luxuriously grouped aft on that splendid yacht crept
into his embittered soul.</p>

<p>He could see the Venetian awning which covered
the clustered fair-faced patrician women from the
fierce sun, which rudely burns by day.</p>

<p>And he knew, too, by distant rumors of that superb
luxury in which the American women of the creed
of the Golden Calf passed their happy days in a
splendid and serene indolence, only lit up now and
then with gleams of the passion play of high life.</p>

<p>“It’s no use to fight those fellows,” mused Vreeland,
as he carefully trimmed a cigar. “They have come
to stay, and I must try and fall into the train of
some one of them.”</p>

<p>He looked back at all those unprofitable years spent
beyond the rugged Rockies. There was a sense of
shame and resentment as he recalled the shabby
career of his talented father.</p>

<p>“Thank God, I am now alone in the world, ‘with
no one nigh to hender!’” he bitterly reflected,
unconsciously quoting Lowell’s “Zekle and Huldy.”</p>

<p>The train had rushed on past Poughkeepsie, and
the parade music from West Point floated sweetly
across the cool river as the train halted at Garrison’s
for a few moments, before he had morosely reviewed
all the dismal events which brought him a lonely
stranger back to New York.</p>

<p>Erastus Vreeland, a lawyer of no mean accomplishment,
had destined his only son for the bar.</p>

<p><a id="png.010" href="#png.010"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The elder Vreeland was a human spider, who had
finally gravitated downward into the exercise of only
the meaner craft of his much-abused profession.</p>

<p>For long years, in his little office on William Street
he had legally carried on the intrigues of a daring
band of clients who rightly should have ornamented
the Academy of Belles-Lettres of New York at Sing
Sing.</p>

<p>During the life of his hoodwinked wife, Vreeland
<i lang="fr">père</i> led a double existence of more or less moral
turpitude, and, at last, a shameless and successful coup
of rascality aroused the ire of a great financial company.</p>

<p>It was his “notice to quit,” and after the death of
his wife, Erastus Vreeland “swung round the distant
circle,” often followed by the <i lang="fr">déclassé</i><!-- TN: original reads "declassé" --> lawyer.</p>

<p>Omaha, Leadville, Salt Lake, Los Angeles, and
other Western cities finally knew his fox-like cunning
and gradually weakening grip.</p>

<p>A political affray, the result of a heated election
in Montana, had been the occasion of the elder
Vreeland’s sudden taking off.</p>

<p>And so, the man who had never learned the homely
adage that “corruption wins not more than honesty,”
slept far away from his fathers on the rocky hillsides
of Helena, in wild Montana. It was a miserable
summation of failures.</p>

<p>The hegira of the father had left the son stranded
in life at the start upon his finishing the four years
at Princeton which had made him an expert in all
the manly arts save any definite plan of money-getting.</p>

<p>A still self-deceiving man, Erastus Vreeland had
hopefully invited his son to share the suggested exile,
and thus, the plan of the law course for the junior was
<a id="png.011" href="#png.011"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>9<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>perforce abandoned. It had not been long till father
and son drifted coldly apart.</p>

<p>The mean, shabby moral nature of the demoralized
elder could not long impose upon the quick-witted
youth. The slights of the bench, the slurs of the
bar, the wasp-like thrusts of a bold frontier press, all
proved that the “trail of the serpent” followed on
after the talented weakling whose professional honor
was never proof against gold or gain secured from
either side.</p>

<p>And so, with only a hypocritical pretense of a
certain lingering friendly feeling, the two men had
finally parted, dividing a few hundred dollars which
were the remains of a retainer in a case, which
deftly went wrong on its trial, sold out, to the benefit
of lawyer Vreeland’s adversary. Then came the
bloody finale—and, and—exit Vreeland <i lang="la">pater</i>!</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland sighed in disgust as he recalled the
five lost years of his golden youthful promise.</p>

<p>“It’s all rot,” he muttered, “this idea that the loafer
life of the far West gives either scope, strength, or courage
to any man. It is all mere barbarism, and only a
windy discounting of a future which never comes.
A long, bootless struggle with the meaner conditions
of life.”</p>

<p>He recalled his varied experiences as notary public,
deputy county clerk, cashier of a shoddy bank—a concern
which “folded its Arabian tents” in six months.</p>

<p>Real estate dealer he had been in several aspiring
“boom towns,” and also, secretary of many frontier
“wind” corporations, whose beautifully engraved
stock certificates were now either carried around in
the pocketbooks of dupes or else stuck up in Western
saloons, to the huge edification of the ungodly.</p>

<p><a id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>This strange wandering life had made him a fox in
cunning, though not as yet a ravening wolf, for there
was little to prey upon in those dreary distant
Occidental preserves. But, his fangs were well
sharpened for the fray.</p>

<p>He realized, as the lights of Haverstraw gleamed
out “beyond the swelling tide,” that he was as yet
without any definite plan of operations.</p>

<p>A singular incident, illustrative of the roughly
good-humored social code of the wild West had caused
him to seek the city of Manhattan.</p>

<p>The political clique which had coolly plotted the
murder of his crafty father, with a last generous
twinge of conscience, had sent all the private papers
of the defunct lawyer over to his son, who was
listlessly engaged at the time in endeavoring, on a
net cash capital of a hundred and fifty dollars, to float
a ten million dollar corporation, in order to utilize certain
waste energy of those foaming falls of the Spokane
River, which have so long caused both the salmon
and the Indians a great deal of unnecessary trouble.</p>

<p>And then, young Vreeland wearily explored those
ashes of life—the “papers in the case” of the defunct.</p>

<p>The unwelcome discovery of many evidences of his
father’s shame and the revealing of all that secret
life which had sent his patient mother to the shadowy
bourne of heartbroken wives, was somewhat mitigated
by the discovery of a paid-up policy of ten
thousand dollars in the great “Acqueduct Life Insurance
of New York City.”</p>

<p>There was, as usual, some strings and filaments
hanging out loosely knotted up, and it had been a
labor of months, involving a correspondence of some
acerbity, for him to obtain letters of administration,
<a id="png.013" href="#png.013"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>close up his father’s “estate,” and depart to Gotham
to receive a check for seven thousand dollars in full
settlement of the claim.</p>

<p>On the road over from Spokane, Mr. Harold Vreeland
had carefully counted all his ships. He had
even gone over all his own abortive attempts at
opening any useful career, and so, on this summer
evening, he gloomily felt how poorly prepared he
was to fight the battle of life against the keen competition
and increasing pressure of his peers in New
York City.</p>

<p>“If I had only my father’s profession, I would have
a chance to get in among these fellows, and I would
soon have my share of the gate money,” he growled.</p>

<p>“But to take a place in the line of mere drudges, to
sink down into the death in life of a hall room and a
cheap boarding-house. Once planted there, I am
there forever. And I have not a friend in the whole
world!”</p>

<p>His mental harvest had only been one of husks,
and he keenly felt the absence of any definite calling
<i lang="fr">pour accrocher</i>.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eye caught the gleam of a sunset upon
a dozen drifting, glittering white sails on the river.</p>

<p>They all seemed to float on serenely, borne along
upon the broad tide, with no visible man’s hand to
guide.</p>

<p>“I will drift a while,” he murmured. “I have a few
thousand dollars. Something will surely turn up.
If it does not,” he resolutely said, “then, I will turn it
up myself.”</p>

<p>“There are women here, too—women with hearts
of flame, and who are to be won. I was a fool ever
to go out to the frontier. <span class="nw">Perhaps—”</span></p>

<p><a id="png.014" href="#png.014"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>And his mind reverted to a lucky college chum who
had married a woman nearly two generations older
than himself, but a well-preserved Madame “Midas.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! anything is better than this beastly
poverty,” he mused. “Even that.”</p>

<p>“This is no era for poor men. Poverty is the only
crime nowadays.”</p>

<p>His cynicism was broken off by the approach of two
men, who rose to rejoin friends in the train as it
dashed along toward the Bronx River.</p>

<p>As they came up the smoking-car, Vreeland easily
recognized Fred Hathorn, the stroke of the college
crew in which he had once won hard-fought honors for
the orange.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the easy luxury which
exhaled from Mr. Fred Hathorn of the great firm of
Hathorn and Potter, bankers and brokers of dingy
Wall Street, a man who had already arrived!</p>

<p>The first crucial glance of rapid inspection was
not lost on Vreeland, as Hathorn, in an easy way
cried: “Hello, Hod Vreeland! What brings you
over here?”</p>

<p>With a perfunctory politeness, Mr. James Potter
halted and calmly acknowledged Hathorn’s listless
introduction.</p>

<p>The little blonde man-about-town, however, gazed
longingly ahead at the car where certain fair dames
now awaited their escorts.</p>

<p>Jimmy Potter was born to “no end of easy money,”
and so his dashing senior partner’s genius for finance
was strongly buttressed by the whirlwind of cash which
clustered around Jimmy Potter’s lucky head.</p>

<p>All sorts of financial bees seemed to swarm around
Potter and quietly settle in his hive.</p>

<p><a id="png.015" href="#png.015"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“What’s the use of making a row?” he often remarked.
“Sit still, and what you want in life will
come to you.” Mr. James Potter of New York was
an Epicurean disciple.</p>

<p>The blood mounted to Vreeland’s forehead as he
noted all the deprecating courtesy of Hathorn’s
welcome.</p>

<p>“Damn him! I’ll give him a bit of a bluff,” he
quickly decided, under the inspiration of some bold,
familiar spirit.</p>

<p>There was an air of quiet comfort in the careless
response of Vreeland.</p>

<p>“I have just fallen into a good bit of money by my
father’s death, and so have come on here to enjoy
myself. I may spend a couple of years abroad.”</p>

<p>Vreeland then blessed that daring, familiar spirit
which so saucily suggested his “cheeky” retort, as
the man who had been his chum and fellow of several
Greek letter societies stopped short. “Wait for me
at the station, old fellow. We are bothered yet with
some ladies. They leave at the station. Then we
will dine later at the club and talk over old times a
bit. You’ll come, too, won’t you, Potter?”</p>

<p>Jimmy Potter carelessly nodded an assent from
sheer laziness, and then the two members of the
<i lang="fr">jeunesse dorée</i><!-- TN: original reads "dorèe" -->, passed on into the boudoir car.</p>

<p>There was a twinkle of triumph in Vreeland’s eye
as he sank back in his seat.</p>

<p>“I got a dinner out of you at any rate, Mr. Snob,”
he gleefully chuckled.</p>

<p>And, highly elated, he decided then and there, to
vary his first plan of drifting with the tide, and to
cautiously put his oar in a bit where it would help
him on.</p>

<p><a id="png.016" href="#png.016"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>His step was as light as the tread of a panther when
he leaped out of the car at Forty-second Street.</p>

<p>“I’ll have a stolen glance at their women,” he
quickly resolved. “Perhaps they may give dinners,
too.”</p>

<p>And just then, there seemed to be the twinkle of a
little star of Hope lighting up that devious, unknown
path which he was so soon to tread.</p>

<p>“I’ll let him give me a Club card,” he mused, as the
wearied passengers hurried along to brave the din of
importunate jehus.</p>

<p>He was wondering how much of a social show he
could make at need with his slender fortune, when
the two men slowly approached with three “shining
ones” of the golden strata of womanly New York.</p>

<p>“These people are all in the swim,” he murmured.
“I will find the way! I am as good as any of them.”</p>

<p>And as he raised his eyes, he met the glances of the
imperial-looking woman who was Fred Hathorn’s
companion.</p>

<p>The lady’s eyes rested for a moment upon the
handsome stranger, and then fell with a peculiar
abruptness.</p>

<p>“If that woman plays any star part in his life, I will
try and take her away from him,” resolved Vreeland,
whose whole soul was now thrilling with the beautiful
woman’s sudden, startled admission of interest in a
passing stranger. The wine of life stirred in the
young wanderer’s veins.</p>

<p>His audacious, familiar sprite suggested the profound
bow which was Mr. Harold Vreeland’s first
salutation upon the outskirts of the “Four Hundred.”</p>

<p>He had adroitly managed to convey the respectful
homage of the salutation by his velvety eyes to the
<a id="png.017" href="#png.017"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>very person intended, for, while Jimmy Potter was
placidly listening to the brilliant chatter of two
very vivacious rosebuds, Mrs. Elaine Willoughby
turned to Hathorn:</p>

<p>“Fred, who is your Western friend?” she asked,
with an assumed carelessness.</p>

<p>It was by sheer good luck that Hathorn, who was
watching the young millionairess whom he was soon
to marry, answered with an unusual warmth:</p>

<p>“An old college chum—Vreeland of Princeton, and
a rattling good fellow.”</p>

<p>Fred Hathorn eyed with a certain qualminess the
easy <i lang="fr">aplomb</i> of his Crœsus partner, as Jimmy Potter
pressed closely to the side of Hathorn’s destined
bride, Miss Moneybags.</p>

<p>That young lady was destined to play the rôle of
Queen of Diamonds in the ambitious young banker’s life.</p>

<p>He had resolutely set up the motto, “<i lang="la">Aut Cæsar,
aut nullus</i>,” and he was just a bit shy of the beloved
James trifling with his dashing fiancée<!-- TN: original reads "fiancèe" -->.</p>

<p>“All sorts of things happen in New York,” mused
the agnostic Hathorn, as he handed the ladies into a
waiting victoria and then turned to rejoin the man
who more than ever had now decided to paddle a bit,
as well as to drift on with the tide of fortune.</p>

<p>There was a glow of satisfaction burning in the
Western adventurer’s heart as, half an hour later,
he noted Hathorn dash off his potent signature behind
his guest’s name on the visitor’s book of the Old
York Club. It was the <i>open sesame</i> to the regions of
the blest—young New York <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>.</p>

<p>The trio adjourned to the billiard room, and, then
and there, Vreeland for the first time tasted the
famous club cocktail.</p>

<p><a id="png.018" href="#png.018"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>He was “living up to his blue china,” as he gravely
bowed when Hathorn gave him a two-weeks’ card.</p>

<p>“I’ll have it renewed for you, old fellow,” lightly
remarked the young banker.</p>

<p>“Pity our waiting list is so long. We must try to
get your name advanced, by hook or crook.”</p>

<p>While Hathorn departed to give his personal orders
for the dinner, Jimmy Potter drew apart to glance
over a handful of cards, letters and <i lang="fr">billets <!-- TN: extraneous ' removed -->d’amour</i>
which a grave old club steward had handed to him.</p>

<p>He critically selected two, the missives of “she who
must be obeyed,” and then carelessly slipped the
fardel of the others into the oblivion of his breast
pocket.</p>

<p>He sat there, the ferret-eyed young millionaire,
glowering after Hathorn’s retreating form. “Pity to
see Alida VanSittart wasted on that cold human calculating
machine! Fred is as indurated as a steel
chisel.”</p>

<p>The little child of Pactolus felt his tiny veins still
tingling with the exhalant magnetism of the budding
heiress whom Hathorn had selected as a second spoke
in that wheel of fortune of which the unconscious
Jimmy was the main stay.</p>

<p>The aforesaid young patrician, Miss Alida, was
“divinely tall” and of a ravishing moonlight beauty,
two elements of ensnaring witchery to the dapper,
<i lang="fr">blasé<!-- TN: original reads "blasè" --></i> young Midas, whose little patent leathers had
pattered vainly along after the stride of that elastic
young goddess.</p>

<p>The alert Vreeland grimly eyed the eager Jimmy
Potter, and noted the tell-tale quiver of the youth’s
slim fingers as he fished out the two “star” leaders
of his evening mail.</p>

<p><a id="png.019" href="#png.019"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I would like just one night with that chap at poker,
with no limit,” gravely mused Vreeland, with an inspirational
sigh. “He looks soft.”</p>

<p>While the <i lang="fr">parvenu</i> “sized up” his man, he was
aware of a hum of murmured comment at a table near
him.</p>

<p>Two men were following with their envious eyes
the tall form of the fortunate Hathorn—“the very
rose and expectancy of the state,” as he called his
myrmidons around him.</p>

<p>“Lucky devil is Hathorn,” quoth A. “Saw him get
out of the train to-night with Mrs. Wharton Willoughby.
Potter over there and a gang of girls have
been up at Lakemere. He still holds her fast.”</p>

<p>Quoth B: “He has a regular run of nigger luck.
Elaine Willoughby is the Queen of the Street. Her
account must be worth a cool hundred thousand a
year to the firm. And here drops in to him, the whole
VanSittart fortune, a cool ten millions.”</p>

<p>Vreeland started as A rejoined moodily: “I had
hoped that some other fellow might have a chance to
make the running at Lakemere, now that Hathorn is
<i lang="fr">rangé</i>; but it really seems to be ‘a <i lang="fr">petit ménage<!-- TN: original reads "mènage" --> à
trois</i>’ so far.”</p>

<p>And B, thereat, enviously growled: “He ought to
cling to the generous woman who made him. I
always thought Hathorn would finally marry her. She
trusts him with her chief account, the —— deals.”
Vreeland cursed the caution which cost him that one
keyword “but, there’s a mystery.”</p>

<p>It was with a wolfish hunger for “more sweetness
and light” that the unmoved Vreeland deftly arose
and followed his host and Potter to a fair upper
chamber of that narrow-chested corner club house on
<a id="png.020" href="#png.020"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Fifth Avenue in the thirties, at whose critic-infested
windows both Miss Patricia and Miss Anonyma
“give a side glance and look down.”</p>

<p>The royal road to fortune which had led the
ambitious Hathorn “on the heights” seemed to be
clear of mist now to his hypocritical visitor.</p>

<p>Was there room for another chariot in the race?
The familiar sprite was busy with daring suggestions.</p>

<p>If a rich woman—not of an age <i lang="fr">très tendre</i>—had
made one man, some other woman of that ilk might
be waiting with a willing heart in the babel of
Gotham for the shapely young Lochinvar come out
o’ the West.</p>

<p>The fires of hope leaped through his veins.</p>

<p>As they seated themselves to the enjoyment of that
particular clear turtle soup which is justly the pride
of the club chef<!-- TN: original reads "chèf" -->, both host and guest were adroitly
playing at cross-purposes.</p>

<p>Hathorn, with a secret avidity entirely New Yorkish,
determined to find out all the details of Vreeland’s
financial windfall.</p>

<p>He had a vague idea that the outlandish wilds of
Montana were stuffed with copper mines, gold ledges,
silver leads, cattle ranches, and “all sorts of things
that might be gotten hold of,” <i>i. e.</i>, other people’s
money.</p>

<p>And if this placid and lamb-like blonde guest had
“dropped into a good thing,” then by a judicious use
of a regulated social hospitality, Hathorn now proposed
to “drop into that same good thing.”</p>

<p>An uneasy fever seems to burn in a New York
man’s blood from the moment when he knows his
neighbor to have an unprotected penny.</p>

<p>The keen-eyed Vreeland minutely examined his
<a id="png.021" href="#png.021"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>old chum’s “get-up,” and quickly decided that he
would closely copy this easily graceful “glass of
fashion and mould of form.”</p>

<p>He had already resolved that he would also try to
make a “run in” at Lakemere, if the cards came
his way.</p>

<p>“I could always give Fred ten points at billiards and
twenty with the women, and then do him every time,”
mused Vreeland. “He only plays a sure-thing
game.”</p>

<p>Vreeland’s own motto had always been “<i lang="fr">De
l’audace! Toujours de l’audace!</i>” and in fact, the
root of his quarrel with his own cowardly father had
been the sniveling, self-deprecatory caution of that
“Old-man-afraid-of-his-record.”</p>

<p>The little dinner was “<i lang="fr">très-soigné</i><!-- TN: original reads "soignè" -->,” for Mr. Fred
Hathorn did everything “decently and in order,” and
it calmly proceeded to the gastronomic delight of
a pleasure-loving man who had long nibbled at jerked
elk and biscuits <i lang="fr">à<!-- TN: original reads "a" --> la</i> Mike Muldoon.</p>

<p>The wines, with their soft suggestion and insinuating
succession, soon led them up to the point where
Fred felt that he “had his man about right.”</p>

<p>The shame-faced Potter, with his mandatory billets
from “She,” burning under his waistcoat, soon mumbled
several iron-clad excuses of unnecessary mendacity
about “seeing a man,” and then gladly escaped,
hustling himself into the hack with all the fond
expectancy of a man who bought quite unnecessary
diamond necklaces loyally and cheerfully for that
queen of bright eyes, Miss Dickie Doubleday of the
Casino.</p>

<p>When the old college comrades were left alone,
even the shaven servitor having fled, over the cigars
<a id="png.022" href="#png.022"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of the incomparable Bock &amp; Co., the two young men
drifted into a considerable <i lang="fr">rapprochement</i>.</p>

<p>The old friendly days came back. Château<!-- TN: original reads "Chateau" --> Yquem,
Pontèt Canet, fine Burgundy, and Pommery Sec have
often mended many a torn thread in the web of friendship,
as well as patched up the little rift in the Lute of
Love. Your sweet devil-born spirit of champagne
always stands smiling at the crossroads of life.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="qt">“And, both reviewed the olden <span class="nw">past—</span></div>
<div class="i1"><span class="ns">  </span>Full many a friend, in battle slain,</div>
<div>And all the war that each had known,</div>
<div class="i1"><span class="ns">  </span>Rose o’er them once again.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The dinner was a “howling success” from the
varying points of view of each sly schemer and his
would-be dupe.</p>

<p>Hathorn smiled knowingly when Vreeland carelessly
remarked that he was not familiar with the dry
details of Montana investments.</p>

<p>“I leave all that drudgery to my lawyers,” he airily
remarked, with all the nerve of a Napoleon Ives.</p>

<p>“I must try and work his account in our direction,”
mused the ardent devotee of business, while Vreeland
gracefully bowed his thanks, when Hathorn rejoined:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Willoughby? Yes. A wonderful woman.
Prettiest place at Irvington. She entertains a great
deal. I’ll ask her if I may present you. She’s
probably the heaviest operator on the Street of all our
rich women.”</p>

<p>It was long after midnight when the two chums
separated.</p>

<p>Their strange life orbits had intersected for the
first time since they sang “Lauriger Horatius”
together in an honest, youthful chorus.</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Vreeland now felt intuitively that his
<a id="png.023" href="#png.023"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>21<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“bluff” was a good one. He had always battled skillfully
enough in the preliminary skirmishes of his
conflict with the world, but he felt that the scene of
action had been poorly chosen.</p>

<p>Hard-hearted and pitiless, he cursed the memory of
his corrupt and inefficient father, as he directed his
lonely steps to the “Waldorf,” to register his name as
a permanent guest.</p>

<p>His heart beat no throb warmer in acknowledgment
of the seven thousand dollars’ windfall which was
to bring his star up from an obscure western declination
to a brilliant eastern right ascension.</p>

<p>He delivered his luggage checks to the night clerk
of New York’s greatest hotel, and proudly inscribed
himself as a member of the “swell mob” filling that
painted Vanity Fair.</p>

<p>A strange fire burned within his veins. He recalled
Fred Hathorn’s final semi-confidential remark: “Do
you know anything of handling stocks? If you do,
we could put you up to a good thing or two on the
Street now.”</p>

<p>It was no lie. The glib story which had fallen
easily from his lips of the six-months’ exciting
experience in which he acted as dummy cashier for
a San Francisco kite-flying “Big Board” firm of
brokers during a sporadic revival of the “Comstock
craze.”</p>

<p>He had learned then how to “wipe out a margin” as
deftly as the veriest scamp who ever signed a fraudulent
“statement” for reckless man or sly, insinuating
woman.</p>

<p>He had artfully led Fred Hathorn on to describe
the unique position of Mrs. Elaine Willoughby
among the bravest of the swim. The New Yorker
<a id="png.024" href="#png.024"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was over-eager in his fencing, and so Vreeland easily
gathered him in.</p>

<p>Lighting a cigar, he strolled along the silent Fifth
Avenue, arranging with quick decision his preliminary
maneuvers.</p>

<p>“This lovely woman who has built up Hathorn
must surely have a vacancy in her heart at present,
vice Hathorn, ‘transferred for promotion’ to head the
VanSittart millions.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good play to come in between them now.
He will never suspect my game, but I’ll block his
little scheme some way, unless he carries me along
upward. He evidently wishes to be rid of the old
<i lang="fr">rapprochement</i> now, and yet not lose her stock business.
By Jove! I would like to cut in there.”</p>

<p>He strolled along toward the “Circassia,” that pink
pearl of all sumptuous apartment palaces, and eagerly
reconnoitered the superb citadel of Elaine Willoughby’s
social fortifications.</p>

<p>“Lakemere, a dream of beauty,” he murmured.
“I’ll soon get into that same gilded circle, and work
the whole set for all they are worth.”</p>

<p>He plumed himself upon the approving glance of
the beautiful brown eyes of the mistress of Lakemere
as she had swept by on Fred Hathorn’s arm.</p>

<p>“She accepted my bow as an evident homage to
her own queenly self,” mused Vreeland, who was no
dabster at reading the ways of the mutable woman
heart.</p>

<p>“Yes, she is my first play. I must burn my ships
and now go boldly in for ‘High Life.’ I’ll risk it.
Carlisle said: ‘There are twenty millions of people
in Britain—mostly fools.’ Among the gilded fools of
Gotham, some one easy mark must be waiting for me
<a id="png.025" href="#png.025"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>on general principles. I’ll take the chances and play
the queen for my whole stack of chips.”</p>

<p>He wandered homeward, after narrowly inspecting
the “Circassia,” and unconsciously attracting the
attention of Daly, the Roundsman, the bravest and
cheeriest member of the Tenderloin police.</p>

<p>Lights still gleamed from a splendid second-floor
apartment above him, where a lovely woman, royal
in her autumnal beauty, gazed out at the night.</p>

<p>Elaine Willoughby sighed as she turned away. “If
I had told Hathorn all, he might have made me his
wife. Alida—” Her face hardened as she choked
down a sob. “My God! if I only knew! I must have
Endicott renew his search.”</p>

<p>In some strange way, the handsome Western
stranger returned to haunt her disturbed mind. “He
looks like a man brave, gallant, and tender,” she
sighed, as she forgot Hathorn, who, in his bachelor
apartments was now musing upon the ways and
means to hold Elaine Willoughby’s heart after he had
wedded Miss Millions.</p>

<p class="chaphead">THE DRIFT OF A DAY IN NEW YORK CITY.</p>


<p>Sparkling lances of golden morning sunbeams broke
and shivered on the fretted golden roof of the Synagogue
by Central Park’s eastern wall of living green.</p>

<p>New York was astir once more, and the daily
burden of life settled down again upon myriads of
galled shoulders. The rumbling trains had rattled
away the blue-bearded mechanic, the pale-faced
clerk, and the ferret-eyed anæmic shop girl to their
daily “demnition grinds” long before Elaine
Willoughby opened her eyes, in the Circassia.</p>

<p>“A breeze of morning moved,” and down the Mall
early pedestrians wandered, while the bridle bits rang
out merrily on the park cantering paths.</p>

<p>Sedentary citizens had strolled along into the leafy
shades for a peep at a cherished book, or a glance at
the horrible of horribles in the “New York Whirl,”
while the recumbent tramp shook himself and hopefully
scuttled forth from his grassy lair to search for
vinous refreshment and to craftily elude the inexorable
“sparrow cop.”</p>

<p>New York City was awakened in the inverse order
of rank, and the passion play of Gotham was on once
more.</p>

<p>The splintered lances danced over the fragrant
God’s acres of the great pleasure ground to the palace
on Central Park west, and as they were gaily reflected
<a id="png.027" href="#png.027"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>25<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>from a silver-framed Venetian mirror, they recalled
Mrs. Wharton Willoughby to that luxurious life of
Gotham in whose fierce splendors there is no rest.</p>

<p>For as burning a flame throbs in the heated maelstrom
of Manhattan as in any human eddy of the
whole distracted globe.</p>

<p>The congestion of careworn faces had filled the
town below Canal Street with its battling disciples of
Mammon long before Mrs. Wharton Willoughby
stepped into her brougham to seek the counsels of
the one man on earth whose integrity was her rock of
Gibraltar, Judge Hiram Endicott, her legal adviser
and trustee.</p>

<p>For the silver-framed mirror had relentlessly
reflected the traces left by the vigil of the night
before.</p>

<p>It was the morning after the storm, and no calm
had yet soothed the troubled soul of the woman whom
thousands envied.</p>

<p>With a fine Gallic perception, Justine, the black-browed,
slyest of French maids, had remarked:
“<i lang="fr">Madame n’ a pas bien dormi?</i>” as she arranged the
filmy coffee service of Dresden eggshell.</p>

<p>Elaine Willoughby was sullen, but resolute, as she
arranged the details of her morning interview by
the Ariel magic of her private telephone.</p>

<p>The ceaseless activity of the Street compelled the
veiled “queen” to have her own “intelligence department”
adjoining her boudoir, a nook with its special
wires leading to Hiram Endicott’s office and even to
his sober Park Avenue home, and its talking wire
also extended to the private office of Frederick Hathorn,
Esq., of Hathorn and Potter, and another handy
wire leading to the lair where the cashier of the
<a id="png.028" href="#png.028"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>26<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Chemical Bank scanned the ebb and flow of Mrs. Elaine Willoughby’s fortune.</p>

<p>A stock ticker and dial telegraph, binding the central
office of the Western Union to the Circassia, were
always stumbling blocks to the insidious Justine, who
earned a vicious golden wage in piping off every
movement of the queen to the adroit Fred Hathorn.</p>

<p>On this particular morning, Hathorn was disturbed
at heart as he answered Justine’s spying warning of
Mrs. Willoughby’s early departure for her downtown
coign of vantage—that room in Judge Endicott’s
offices in the Hanover Bank building, which was
<i lang="la">terra incognita</i> even to him. The corner of Pine and
Nassau was an Ehrenbreitstein.</p>

<p>For Hathorn’s acutest schemes had never yet
given him the open sesame to the room adjoining
Hiram Endicott’s study bearing the simple inscription
“Office Willoughby Estate.”</p>

<p>There, Madame Elaine was safe, even from him.</p>

<p>He grumbled: “I don’t half like the way Elaine
eyed Alida VanSittart yesterday. There was a storm
signal in my lady’s glances. If she should draw away
her <span class="nw">account—”</span></p>

<p>He shuddered, for he was well overdrawn in his
personal relations with Mr. Jimmy Potter, who had
just meekly slunk into his office, with quivering
nerves and much pink-eyed indications of the aftermath
of “a cosy little evening at Miss Dickie Doubleday’s.”</p>

<p>“I must keep her well in hand till I pull off the
marriage. Sugar is on the jump, too. There’s a
half million if I follow her sure lead.</p>

<p>“By God! I would give ten years of my life to
know who posts her in that saccharine article of
<a id="png.029" href="#png.029"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>prime necessity. I will give her something to interest
her. Yes; the very thing! I’ll run in Hod
Vreeland there.</p>

<p>“He is a new face, and she may forget to harry
Alida in the new man’s initiation at Lakemere. And
I’ll go up and see her this afternoon myself.”</p>

<p>When he had telephoned his carefully-worded
message to Justine, to be delivered to Mrs. Willoughby
on her return, he ordered a basket of
orchids to precede his call at the Circassia, and then,
with a fine after-thought, telegraphed “Mr. Harold
Vreeland, Hotel Waldorf,” to await his call on
important business after dinner.</p>

<p>“If I am going to use Vreeland, I may as well put
him into play right now,” cheerfully mused Hathorn,
as he lit a Prince of Wales cigarette.</p>

<p>“I can pay that devil Justine a bit extra to watch
Hod Vreeland’s little game with Elaine.</p>

<p>“A bit of healthy flirtation may cause her to forget
Alida shining her down.</p>

<p>“Whirlwind speculator as she is, the Willoughby is
one of Eve’s family, after all. ‘But yet a woman!’
I wonder <span class="nw">if—”</span></p>

<p>His reverie was cut off by the entrance of Mr. Jimmy Potter, who calmly remarked: “Sugar is
going hellward! You had better get out and see
about where we will land!”</p>

<p>Mr. Fred Hathorn had unwittingly passed one of
the cross-roads of life and a knowledge of his proposed
actions would have been Balm of Gilead to the
anxious soul of Harold Vreeland, who was busily
engaged with the great tailor, Bell—manufacturer of
gentlemen <i lang="fr">à<!-- TN: original has "a" --> la mode</i>.</p>

<p>The crafty Vreeland’s heart would have bounded
<a id="png.030" href="#png.030"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>had he realized how true was the debonnair Jimmy
Potter’s one golden maxim. “Hold on quietly, and
what you want will come around to you!”</p>

<p>The arched doors of the Circassia, the superb gateways
of Lakemere were being slowly swung for him,
by the scheming man who cunningly proposed to
divert the Montana bonanza into the coffers of Hathorn
and Potter.</p>

<p>Mr. Potter, in his pink-eyed awakening from a
night’s folly, was now standing at the bar of the
Savarin, gloomily reflecting upon certain rashnesses of
his own on the preceding evening.</p>

<p>These little extravaganzas, greatly to the profit
and delight of Miss Dickie Doubleday, had been all
unsolicited by that sinewy-hearted young beauty.</p>

<p>“The biggest fool in the world is the man who fools
himself!” sadly ejaculated Potter, as he shed his
burden of care with the half dollar dropped for a
“high ball.”</p>

<p>He crept back to watch Fred Hathorn battling in
the Sugar pit, with all the admiration of a fainéant<!-- TN: original reads "faineant" -->
for an energetic man.</p>

<p>“Great fellow, Fred!” proudly reflected Mr. Jimmy,
with one last wormwood pang for the robbery of that
young Diana, Alida VanSittart.</p>

<p>“She outclasses him—ranks him—clean out of
sight!” sadly mourned Potter. “Now, if I was only
clear of the Doubleday, I <span class="nw">might—”</span></p>

<p>But, an aching head cut short his half-formed
determination.</p>

<p>“I suppose that she is like all the others!” sighed
Potter.</p>

<p>“These New York girls’ hearts are like a ball of
string, unwind the thing—and—there’s nothing left!”</p>

<p><a id="png.031" href="#png.031"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>29<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Mrs. Elaine Willoughby, on her way down town,
had stolen another glimpse at her own disturbed
face. The <i lang="fr">crise des nerfs</i> had clearly brought out to
her the presaged passing of her beauty.</p>

<p>The little hand glass of the brougham told her,
with brutal abruptness, that the face she was gravely
studying must pale before the moonlight radiance of
Alida VanSittart.</p>

<p>Face to face with her own sorrow, she saw the truth
at last. Was it envy of the nymph-like girl or a dull
hatred of Hathorn, for his cold ingratitude, which
racked her heart?</p>

<p>“Perhaps, if I had told him all,” she murmured,
“I will find out the lost link of my life yet, and there
must be a man somewhere who would prove worthy
of a woman’s whole confidence.</p>

<p>“One who could wander in le Jardin Secret, by
my side!”</p>

<p>As she studied her own face, with a needless self-deprecation,
there came back to her the handsome
Western stranger.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she dreamily said, as her mind wandered
away to the great dim Sierras, “uplifting their minarets
of snow,” “he may have caught their majestic secret of
truth and lofty freedom.”</p>

<p>And—she, too, drifted on to a cross-road of life.</p>

<p>Elaine Willoughby had finished her inspection of
the counterfeit presentment afforded by the little
mirror.</p>

<p>Though matters of both head and heart claimed all
the exercise of her mental powers on this morning,
she was lost in a vexing comparison of her own
personal charms with those of Alida VanSittart.</p>

<p>The lady had never fathomed the reason why the
<a id="png.032" href="#png.032"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>wise Thales had formulated his priceless proverb of
three words into the cramped diction, “Man! Know
Thyself!”</p>

<p>The antique sage wisely refrained from saying,
“Woman! Know Thyself!” for, far beyond the clouds
wrapping the misty ruins of Greece, Rome and the
Nile, the woman of yesterday never had been the
woman of to-day, nor her chameleon substitute of
to-morrow.</p>

<p>The only thing unvarying in womanhood, is its
infinite emotional variety. Not one in a million of
that charming sex has ever mastered the secret of
their strange enigmas of varying loves, and the
one only anchored feeling of motherhood.</p>

<p>The divine Shakespeare’s words, “’Tis brief! Aye—as
woman’s love!” are supplemented by the great-hearted
Mrs. Browning’s feminine lines, “Yes! I
answered you last night. No! this morning, sir, I say!”</p>

<p>Elaine Willoughby did not know herself. She resolutely
put away the reason why she ignored all the
hawk-eyed young Gibson beauties of Irvington, Tarrytown,
and Ardsley, to nourish a resentment alone
against that slim Diana, Alida VanSittart.</p>

<p>Woman of the world, throned upon a golden pedestal
of wealth—mistress of secrets that would shake
the financial world—she had also enjoyed the homage
of men long enough to know every one of her own
good points.</p>

<p>There had been hours of triumph, too. For, after
all, a woman’s heart beat behind the silken armor of
her Worth robes.</p>

<p>Still in the bloom of a meridian beauty, no one in
Gotham knew but Hiram Endicott that her years
were thirty-seven.</p>

<p><a id="png.033" href="#png.033"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Her brunette loveliness of face was accentuated by
the molded symmetry of her Venus de Milo form.</p>

<p>Men knew her only as the childless widowed chatelaine
of Lakemere, the inheritor of a vast fortune
hazily dating from Colorado.</p>

<p>A few cold words from that oracle, Judge Hiram
Endicott, had dispelled any doubts as to the authenticity
of the late Wharton Willoughby.</p>

<p>The checks of the woman whom all had failed to
win were considered among the cognoscenti as gilt-edged
as Treasury Certificates.</p>

<p>The grave glances of her sole attorney and trustee
were also a no thoroughfare to prying gossipers, and
it was only by a long series of stealthy financial sleuth
work that the financial world discovered both “sugar”
and “oil” to be as granite buttresses to the unshaken
pyramid of her solid wealth. On the Street she was a
whirlwind operator—with “inside tips!”</p>

<p>As the brougham swung along through Pine Street,
Mrs. Willoughby caught a single glimpse of Fred
Hathorn, eager-eyed, and hurrying to the Stock
Exchange.</p>

<p>The man of thirty-five had risen to be a clubman—a
yachtsman of renown—a man of settled fortune—and
a social lion, too, in the five years since she had
opened the gates of her heart to admit the handsome
struggling youth, then paddling feebly in Wall Street’s
foaming breakers.</p>

<p>She leaned back with a sigh. Hathorn’s sudden
apparition had opened her eyes to the reason of her
dull hatred of the millionaire fiancée<!-- TN: original reads "fiancèe" -->.</p>

<p>“He is the reason why I hate that girl,” she murmured,
with misty lashes, and an old saw came back
to her.</p>

<p><a id="png.034" href="#png.034"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>32<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“It is hard to look out on a lover’s happiness
through another man’s eyes!”</p>

<p>In the gilded throng at Lakemere, the proprietary
endearments of Frederick Hathorn had galled her
stormy soul. She knew not that the <i lang="fr">parvenu</i> broker
was only publicly sealing, beyond a doubt, the projected
union which would make him the equal in
capitalistic reserve of that easy-going Son of Fortune,
Potter, to whom all things came around—even Miss
Dickie Doubleday’s bills.</p>

<p>A ray of light lit up her darkened heart.</p>

<p>“Alida is innocent of wrecking my happiness. She
could know nothing. For I have been silent! And
if I held the ladder, can I blame him for climbing?
He needs me no longer.</p>

<p>“I have been only a means to an end. Alida will
be the last. And then, Frederick Hathorn, Esquire,
is safely in the swim!”</p>

<p>A sudden conviction of the uselessness of her affectation
of a semi-maternal interest in the fortunes of
the hardened man of thirty-five told her that she had
left all the doors open to him.</p>

<p>For there was that in her own life, dating back to
her girlhood, which she had never even revealed
to her half-lover protégé.</p>

<p>With her rich womanly nature sorely shaken, her
tender dark eyes drooping, she now owned to the
hope, now fled forever, that Hathorn would light the
beacon of love in her lonely heart. “I have not
trusted him,” she murmured. “He owes me nothing,
nothing but gratitude.”</p>

<p>Too late, she saw that mere gratitude does not
kindle into love, and a sense of her own lack of
frankness sealed her accusing lips.</p>

<p><a id="png.035" href="#png.035"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I can not blame Hathorn!” she murmured. “It is
my own fault. I told him the truth, but—not the
whole truth!”</p>

<p>Still, she suffered from the shattering of flattering
hopes long secretly cherished, and saw now the marriage
of her financial <i lang="fr">éleve</i> as a future bar to the
confidential relations which had linked him to her
fortunes with golden chains.</p>

<p>“They will go on and play the game of life brilliantly
without me—these two, whom I have unwittingly
brought together. I will go on alone—now—to
the end—unless I can find the lost thread.</p>

<p>“Endicott must reopen the search! I will spend a
half million—and—that other heart shall know mine!”
She was lost in the memories of a buried past.</p>

<p>As she entered the vestibule of the office building,
a grave manly voice aroused her.</p>

<p>“I thought that you should know this,” whispered
Hugh Conyers, of the New York <cite>Clarion</cite>. “It has
just come over the wires from Washington.</p>

<p>“I was going up to tell the Judge, and have him
send for you. You will have a busy day.”</p>

<p>The startled woman read a slip which was the
burden of the lightning Ariel which had set “Sugar
soaring hellward” in the classic diction of James
Potter, Esq.</p>

<p>“Hugh!” gasped the Queen of the Street, as she
drew him into a dark corner, “can I never reward
you for your loyalty? Is there nothing I can do for
you?”</p>

<p>The Knight of the Pen laughed gaily, as he pocketed
the yellow slip. “Not now! Lady Mine! You paid
in advance when you saved Sara’s life by sending her
away to Algiers! I’m off to the office. When you
<a id="png.036" href="#png.036"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>can give two respectably poor people an evening, send
for us, that’s all—but, we want you all to ourselves!</p>

<p>“If there is anything more, I will come around.
Shall I tell this to Hathorn?” His eyes were fixed
eagerly upon her.</p>

<p>There was a slight ring of hardness in her voice, as
she hastily said:</p>

<p>“Not a word to him, in future. He is going to
marry—and—go away for a time. I will handle this
line alone—after this—only report to the Judge. He
is my Rock of Gibraltar.”</p>

<p>She disappeared in the elevator with a hard little
laugh. For she was trying to make light of the blow
which had told upon her lonely heart.</p>

<p>The newspaper man edged his way up Nassau Street
in a brown study.</p>

<p>“Coming events cast their shadows before,” he
muttered. “I wonder if she will ever know? Some
day, perhaps.”</p>

<p>Darting messenger boys and disgruntled pedestrians
eyed wrathfully the high-browed man of forty, who
strode along with his gray eyes fixed on vacancy.</p>

<p>One or two “business women” noted the clean-cut,
soldierly features, the well-shaped head, with all the
intellectual stamp of old Amherst, brightened by the
fierce intellectual rivalry of the nervous New York
press.</p>

<p>Artist, athlete, and thinker, Hugh Conyers had
hewed his upward way through the press of bread
winners out into the open, and, still sweet-hearted
and sincere, he steadily eyed without truckling, New
York’s golden luxury, and saw, with a living sympathy,
the pathetic tragedies of the side eddies of
Gotham’s stiller waters.<!-- TN: period invisible --></p>

<p><a id="png.037" href="#png.037"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>From his cheery den, where his sister Sara Conyers’
flowers of art bloomed, the writer looked out unmoved
upon the Walpurgis nights of winter society—the mad
battles of Wall Street—and the shabby abandon of
New York City’s go-as-you-please summer life.</p>

<p>It was only in his faraway summer camp, by the
cheery fire, under the friendly stars, or out on the
dreaming northern lakes, floating in his beloved birch
canoe, that he opened his proud heart to nature—and
then, perchance, murmured in his sleep—a name
which had haunted his slumbers long.</p>

<p>“So! It’s all over between them!” mused Hugh, as
he was swallowed up in a lair of clanking presses and
toiling penmen. “Mr. Fred Hathorn has arrived.
God help his wife to be! The Belgian granite
paving block is as tender as that golden youth’s
heart.”</p>

<p>He well knew that the artful protégé had only used
the generous woman’s volunteered bounty of the past—“as
means to an end.”</p>

<p>“Elaine has simply coined her golden heart for that
smart cad!” he sighed, as he grasped a blunted spear
of a pencil to dash off an editorial upon “German
Influence in the South Seas.”</p>

<p>In her guarded downtown office, Mrs. Elaine Willoughby
resolutely put aside the one subject now
nearest her heart, to summon, by signal, the fortunate
man who was fast slipping out of her life.</p>

<p>The startled Queen of the Street gave but ten
minutes’ time to the consideration of the sudden
change in the affairs of a giant syndicate which used
two hundred millions of dollars in swaying the world
of commercial slaves at its feet.</p>

<p>A warning word from Hiram Endicott’s nephew
<a id="png.038" href="#png.038"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>(his sole confidant) told her that her lawyer-trustee
had just been summoned, privately, to meet the
inscrutable Chief of the Syndicate.</p>

<p>With keen acumen, she reviewed the hostile probing
of a mighty Senate, into the Sealed Book of the great
Trust’s affairs.</p>

<p>From her own safe, she then extracted a memorandum
book and grimly smiled, as she noted a date—May
17, 1884.</p>

<p>She quickly read over two cipher letters, dated
“Arlington Hotel, Washington, D.C.,” which had been
silently handed her by Endicott’s only relative, and
murmured, “Can it be that the Standard Oil people
are going to quietly buy in and wager their vast fortunes
on the double event?</p>

<p>“Hiram will know—and—what he knows we will
keep to ourselves!”</p>

<p>A sense of absolute safety possessed her when she
reflected that the sole depositary of her life secrets—the
one man <i lang="fr">au courant</i> with her giant speculations
was a childless widower and had passed the age when
passions’ fires glow—and was, moreover, rich beyond
all need of future acquisition.</p>

<p>Pride kept Hiram Endicott still in the ranks of his
profession, while the acquired taste of money-making
filled up the long days darkened by the loss of wife
and daughter.</p>

<p>When Hathorn, replying to her summons with an
anxious brow, entered the room where the beautiful
architect of his fortunes awaited him, he found a
strange serenity brooding upon her face.</p>

<p>With a brief greeting, he plunged in <i lang="la">media res</i>. His
report was quickly made.</p>

<p>The unmoved listener quietly remarked, “Hold my
<a id="png.039" href="#png.039"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>account out of all future deals in Sugar. Do nothing
whatever. I may go away for a few weeks. I do
not care for this little flurry. I will stand out—and—the
Judge will keep that line safe.”</p>

<p>The quiet decision of Elaine Willoughby’s orders
gave the quietus to the young man’s eager plans for a
great coup.</p>

<p>Watching her craftily from the corners of his eyes,
he lightly turned to the proposed visit of that interesting
Montana capitalist, Harold Vreeland.</p>

<p>“Bring him to see me, by all means!” the Lady of
Lakemere cordially said. “He seems to have caught
a bit of the breeziness of the pines.”</p>

<p>And then, when Hiram Endicott briskly entered,
Mr. Frederick Hathorn fled away to the renewed
struggles of the Exchange.</p>

<p>The quondam “only broker” was, however, not
deceived. He raced on through the excited street to
cover the firm’s large line of the rapidly advancing
stock, and reasoned quickly as he went.</p>

<p>In his heart there was the conviction of a coming
change in the generous heart which had been so long
open to him.</p>

<p>“Elaine is a deep one,” he wrathfully mused. “She
is either flying too high for me to follow in this—or
else, she is ‘moving in a mysterious way her wonders
to perform.’”</p>

<p>He knew her nature too well to question her explicit
orders.</p>

<p>The nerve of a duelist, the honor of a caballèro, the
courage of a plumed knight—all these were her
attributes, and he was not mad enough to doubt that
she knew her own mind.</p>

<p>The “moaning of the sea of change” oppressed him.
<a id="png.040" href="#png.040"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“She has got out beyond me,” he grumbled, and
then, with all the experience born of his social life
“above board” and “under the rose,” he failed to
remember any case wherein a loving woman had gone
madly wild in approval of a man’s devotion to another
daughter of Eve.</p>

<p>“I was a fool to take Alida up there to Lakemere,
and fret my best customer with the ‘billing and cooing’
act! It was a bad play—and—yet, the break had to
come!”</p>

<p>He swore a deep oath that he would, when married,
hold Alida VanSittart well in hand, and still cling to
the desirable business of the woman who had made
his fortune.</p>

<p>“Here’s Vreeland,” he hopefully planned. “Just
the fellow! Ardent, young, an interesting devil, and,
rich. He will help to fill up the measure of her lonely
days—and, his game can never cross my own.</p>

<p>“He’s a mighty presentable fellow, too, and I can
perhaps strengthen my hold on her through him.”</p>

<p>A cautionary resolve to keep the handsome Western
traveler away from Miss Alida VanSittart was born of
the slight uneasiness caused by the gilded Potter’s
attentions to the tall young nymph of the court of
Croesus. “She is my ‘<i lang="la">sine qua!</i>’” he smiled. “No
fooling around there!”</p>

<p>It was four o’clock before the busy Hathorn could
get the nose of his financial bark steered safely over
the saccharine breakers of the Sugar market.</p>

<p>And, still, a growing excitement filled the aspiring
young banker’s veins.</p>

<p>While he had struggled on the floor of the
Exchange, he was suddenly smitten with a fear that
his patroness had abruptly abandoned him.</p>

<p><a id="png.041" href="#png.041"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>He sent a confidential lad over to watch Judge Endicott’s
office, and he was soon rewarded with the
reliable news that the serene goddess of Pactolus had
calmly driven away after an hour’s stay at her
trustee’s office.</p>

<p>“What is she up to?” he fretted. “I’ll find out if
she really goes home!” he then decided, with a growing
uneasiness, as he marked the surging tide of Sugar
speculation.</p>

<p>He was fortunate enough to attract the personal
attention of Harold Vreeland, of Montana, for that
new member of the <i lang="fr">jeunesse dorée</i><!-- TN: original reads "dorèe" --> was held socially in
eclipse, until Bell’s minions should purvey the “robes
of price” suited to the swelling port assumed by the
bold social gambler.</p>

<p>The hearty assent of the fancied dupe to the evening
call, enabled Hathorn to call his patroness by the
private wire at the Circassia.</p>

<p>“By Jove! She is lucky to be out of this flurry!” he
decided, when Mrs. Willoughby’s voice closed the
telephonic interview without even a passing reference
to “the market.” “She did go home after all!”</p>

<p>And, so lulled to security, he remembered all the
vastness of her varied moneyed interests. He knew
only the magnitude of her transactions in the past.</p>

<p>The hidden reasons of her Napoleonic moves he had
never penetrated, and he had vainly shadowed her
visits to Washington and sifted the guests at her summer
palace. But now, his future control was endangered.</p>

<p>The crowd of guests, would-be suitors, financial and
political friends hovering around her, embraced
judges, generals, senators, governors, national statesmen,
and party leaders.</p>

<p><a id="png.042" href="#png.042"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Every social door was open to the mistress of Lakemere—and
her smile, like the sunshine, beamed
impartially upon all. So, the veiled espionage of the
past had been fruitless.</p>

<p>The paid revelations of Justine had so far only
rewarded him with the recurring details of the suing
of many sighing gallants kneeling before her guarded
golden shrine.</p>

<p>In the first months of the cementing of their past
friendship, he had even dared to dream of a personal
conquest, but the high-minded frankness of her kindness
had soon killed that youthful conceit.</p>

<p>And now, to-day, he felt that the golden chain had
snapped beyond him, and that he really had never
fathomed the inner nature of the queenly woman.</p>

<p>But one unreserved intimacy characterized her
guarded life. The union of interest between herself
and Hiram Endicott.</p>

<p>Hard-hearted and mean-spirited, Hathorn clung for
a year to the idea that the wealthy lawyer was perhaps
the Numa Pompilius of this blooming woman
whose roses of life were yet fragrant with summer’s
incense.</p>

<p>But the vastness of her transactions, and even the
results of his mean spying, left him, at last, absolutely
persuaded that they were not tied by any personal
bond.</p>

<p>The “man who had arrived” lacked the delicacy of
soul to know that the prize might have been his, had
he been true to the ideal which Elaine Willoughby
had formed of him. For, he had never been frank-hearted
enough to risk her refusal.</p>

<p>He had never forgotten the night, years ago, when
he had boldly avowed to her that he had not a real
<a id="png.043" href="#png.043"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>friend in the world. It had been with only a coarse
joy in his coming good fortune, that he had listened
to her answer, “You must come to me again.”</p>

<p>That night, five years before, Elaine Willoughby
had whispered to her own blushing face in her
mirror, “I can make a social power of him. I can
build up his fortunes. Men shall know and honor
him—and <span class="nw">then—”</span></p>

<p>She had never completed that sentence, framing a
wish that she dared not name in words.</p>

<p>But he had at last coldly passed her by, and knelt
before the feet of a mere girl, who valued him only
for what the silent benefactress had made him. It
was a cruel stroke.</p>

<p>“She is different from all the other women I have
ever met!” ruefully sighed Hathorn, who now saw
that the great Sugar intrigues were sealed from his
future ken. He had watched the artful juggling of
government bonds finally make a daring and aspiring
New York banker rise to be a rival of the Rothschilds.
He knew, by gossipy chatter, of the American Sugar
Company’s alleged veiled participation in the great
New York campaign of 1892.</p>

<p>He saw the Sugar Trust moving on to a reported
influence in national affairs, and, keenly watching
every lucky stroke of the Queen of the Street, he was
persuaded that the finest threads of the vast intrigue
in some hidden way ran through her slender jeweled
hands. He saw his fault too late.</p>

<p>“I might have known all—if I had married her!” he
decided, as he hid his disturbed countenance in a
coupé on his way uptown.</p>

<p>He was conscious of that slight chill of change
<a id="png.044" href="#png.044"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>42<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>which is an unerring indication of a woman’s secret
resolve.</p>

<p>But a last brilliant thought came to the puzzled
trickster. It seemed a golden inspiration.</p>

<p>“Here is Vreeland, heart-free and foot-loose. I
can exploit him and get him into the best houses in
a month. He is not a marrying man.</p>

<p>“If I can work him into our stock business, I may
regain her—through him—and I’ll keep Alida out of
her sight. She may fancy him. I’ll post Vreeland,
and, perhaps, he may find the key to her hold on the
Sugar deals.</p>

<p>“With Justine in my pay, and Vreeland well coached,
I may yet fathom the inner arcanum of the great impending
deal.</p>

<p>“A union of the Sugar Trust and the Standard Oil
interests would make the heaviest financial battery of
modern times—and—by Jove—they would be able to
swing Uncle Sam’s policy at will. Yes! I will push
Vreeland to the front.”</p>

<p>With a hopeful glance at a sober banking structure,
not far from the corner of Wall and Broad, the day-dreamer
murmured, “I might even rise like him,” as
he caught sight of a gray-mustached man, now supposed
to be comfortably staggering along under the
weight of a hundred brilliantly won millions.</p>

<p>“I have Alida VanSittart’s money—as an anchor.
I will use this Vreeland as my tool. He’s an open-hearted
fellow.”</p>

<p>Hiram Endicott, at the corner, watched the young
banker dash by. The old lawyer’s thin form was still
erect at sixty-five. His stern cameo face, and steady
frosty eye, comported with his silken white hair.</p>

<p>He strode on, with the composed manner of an old
<a id="png.045" href="#png.045"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>43<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>French marquis. His heart was wrung with the
passionate appeal of Elaine Willoughby to reopen an
unavailing search of years. For she bore, in silence,
a secret burden.</p>

<p>The morning had been given to the calm discussion
of new means to unlock a mystery of the past, “to
pluck out a rooted sorrow.”</p>

<p>Endicott’s nephew was now in sole charge of the
giant battle with loaded dice, in the ring of Sugar
speculation. The lawyer alone knew that Hathorn’s
sceptre had departed from him. He cursed the
retreating gallant.</p>

<p>“Can it be that the marriage of this cold-hearted
young trickster has opened her eyes to the folly of
educating a husband, <i lang="la">in posse</i>?</p>

<p>“Or—is it the shadow of the old sorrow, Banquo-like,
returning? God bless her. I fear it is a hopeless
quest.”</p>

<p>And yet, with all the fond dissimulation of Eve’s
family, Elaine Willoughby was serenely radiant that
night as the cautious Hathorn led the “open-hearted
fellow” into the splendors of the Circassia. “This
plan of mine will work,” mused Hathorn, who did
not see the gleam of triumph in Vreeland’s eyes when
the hostess asked him to visit her dreamy domain of
Lakemere.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 title="III. A frank disclosure"
 ><a id="png.046" href="#png.046"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>44<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p class="chaphead">A FRANK DISCLOSURE.</p>


<p>Hathorn returned, thoroughly hoodwinked, from
the introductory evening spent at the Circassia. It
had seemed strange to him that a leading general of
the regular army, and a dapper French author, then
in the brief blaze of his “lionship,” with a grave
senator and a returned Polar explorer should have
been called to meet together at the dinner table.
“It’s Elaine’s incomparable way of making a delightful
<i lang="es">olla podrida</i> of the social menu,” he mused, as he
watched the hostess narrowly. “<i lang="fr">Caviare</i> to the
General!”</p>

<p>When he had found time to whisper a confidential
word as to the enormous Sugar sales of the day, the Lady
of Lakemere only laughed merrily. “I have now a soul
above Sugar! I shall put my ‘Trust’ elsewhere!”
And then, in her serious way, she slowly said: “Wait
here with your Western friend, till all these other people
go!” And he, with a budding hope, eagerly
awaited her pleasure as of old.</p>

<p>Elaine’s unruffled brow bore no business shades
when she drew Hathorn aside for a moment into her
boudoir, leaving the luxury-loving Vreeland wandering
around spell-bound in a frank admiration of the
queen’s jewel-box. For so, the spacious apartment
was termed in the circle of “le Petit Trianon.”</p>

<p>“This is only my catch-all, Mr. Vreeland,” cried
Elaine, as she swept past him. “You must see Lakemere.
There you can linger—and—admire.”</p>

<p><a id="png.047" href="#png.047"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>45<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Harold Vreeland’s silent oath of obedience followed
the woman, who fixed her sweetly serious eyes on the
agitated Hathorn, in the well-remembered room where
their hearts had so often throbbed with quickened
beats. “Was it to be a <i lang="fr">rapprochement</i>?”</p>

<p>“It is only fair to tell you, Fred,” she simply said,
“that I shall have to avoid all excitements this summer.
Doctor Hugo Alberg is not at all satisfied with
my heart action. And, a tranquil rest at Lakemere is
his sole prescription. Now, as I shall probably stay
there till October first, I shall leave my speculative
stock account to be handled by Judge Endicott, who
has my sole power of attorney.”</p>

<p>The mystified broker stood aghast at losing his pet
account for such a long period. Was she leaving the
Street forever? He faltered, “And this <span class="nw">means—”</span></p>

<p>“That you must hasten your marriage. There are
other things in life beside making money. Of
course, I have confided only in you. Potter can not
trust himself—and so, I can not trust him with the
secrets of any of my financial movements. You are
the one young Napoleon of your firm.</p>

<p>“So, if you really wish to go abroad, then make
Alida a June bride. I shall avoid touching the Street
till late in October—and then, when your European
tour is over, I shall be able to take up the game of
pitch and toss again.”</p>

<p>He was conscious that she was keenly watching
him. “Of course,” he slowly said, “it gives me all
the time I want. I was really concerned about your
interests. It is a good plan, and I may be able to get
Vreeland to play amateur banker in my place for a
few months. Potter and he seem to fancy each
other. I’ll talk to Alida. This will probably suit her
<a id="png.048" href="#png.048"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>46<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>wishes.” It all looked fair enough, and yet—his
bosom was filled with a vague alarm.</p>

<p>“I have already selected my present, Fred,” merrily
said the Queen of the Street. “Take time by the forelock,
and give up these lovely summer months to young
love.” The broker’s eyes were gleaming as he said,
“Can it be possible that you have gone out of Sugar
on the eve of a ten per cent surplus dividend? I
heard that inside rumor to-day. You know how dear
to me all your interests are.”</p>

<p>He now felt that there was that behind the arras
which was skillfully veiled from him. For her eyes
were shining coldly over the smiling lips.</p>

<p>The dark-eyed woman simply said, “Tempt me
not. I have promised Doctor Alberg to refrain.</p>

<p>“So, go and make yourself Benedick, the married
man. It is the time of roses—you must pluck them
as you pass. Come to me—when you have settled
this matter. I will give you a social send-off at
Lakemere worthy of ‘the high contracting parties.’”</p>

<p>Her voice was thrilling him now as of old, and yet,
with all her kindness, he instinctively felt that something
was going out of his life forever.</p>

<p>“It will be always the same between us, Elaine,”
the young Napoleon murmured. She had risen and
turned toward the door.</p>

<p>“Did you ever know me to change?” she softly said,
as she glided out to begin a cordial <i lang="fr">tête-à<!-- TN: original reads "a" -->-tête</i> with
Vreeland. There was no further intimate exchange
of thoughts possible between the secretly estranged
couple, and, now keenly on guard, in a disturbed
state of mind, Mr. Frederick Hathorn lingered in
converse late that night at the Old York Club, with
his quondam friend.</p>

<p><a id="png.049" href="#png.049"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Harold Vreeland’s conduct at his debut had been
perfectly adapted to Elaine Willoughby’s changeful
mood. The deep courtesy of a perfect self-effacement,
and his coldly-designed waiting policy soothed her
strangely restless heart.</p>

<p>The woman who once could have married Hathorn
was now feverishly eager to see him haled to the bar
of matrimony.</p>

<p>“Once that he is <i lang="fr">rangé</i>—I am then sure of myself
again,” she murmured, as she saw her perfectly composed
face for the last time that night in the silver-framed
mirror. And yet, she knew that it was but a
social mask. There was an anticipatory revenge, however,
in the fact that Hiram Endicott had reported
the private pooling of her enormous Sugar holdings
with those of the great chief of the vast Syndicate.</p>

<p>The ten per cent bonus dividend, long artfully held
back, was her assured profit now, and Hugh Conyers’<!-- TN: original reads "Conyer's" -->
watchful loyalty had made “assurance doubly sure.”</p>

<p>Endicott had already sent out a dozen agents to take
up once more the secret quest which had so often
failed them—and these “legal affairs” naturally gave
him the excuse for a tri-weekly visit to Lakemere.</p>

<p>“So, Mr. Frederick Hathorn, as you have locked
the door of my heart on the outside, you may now
throw away the useless key!” she mused “I will
find my best defense against any weakness in the
keen-witted young wife who will surely show you
yet the thorns on the rosebud.”</p>

<p>Dreams of the past mingled with the shapes of the
present, as the lady of Lakemere laid her shapely
head to rest.</p>

<p>“He has irreproachable manners, at least,” was her
last thought, as the unconscious psychology of
<a id="png.050" href="#png.050"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>mighty Nature brought the graceful Vreeland back
to her mind. “I wonder if he is at heart like—the
other?”</p>

<p>And so, all ignorant of the power of this self-confessed
womanly yearning toward the handsome
young stranger, Elaine Willoughby fell asleep, to
dream of the crafty man who had not yet forgotten
how her liquid eyes had dropped under his ardent gaze.</p>

<p>The laws of nature are the only inviolable code of
life, and blindly the lady of Lakemere had passed on,
all unwittingly, toward a turning point in her lonely
life. Her barrier of pride only fenced out the ungrateful
Hathorn, condemned for ingratitude.</p>

<p>Vreeland, following carefully upon Fred Hathorn’s
curvilinear conversational path, easily divined the
uncertainty of the greedy young broker’s mind.</p>

<p>“He wants Miss Millions, and yet, he would not
lose his fairy godmother,” thought the crafty adventurer.
“I shall go slow and let them make the game.</p>

<p>“But wait till I am the guiding spirit of Lakemere.
She shall come forward inch by inch, and he shall
unfold to me every weak spot in his armor.”</p>

<p>They had finished a grilled bone and a “bottle”
before Hathorn foxily sought to draw out his friend
as to the details of the Montana bonanza. The plan
of an amateur four-months’ Wall Street experience was
quietly and deftly brought in.</p>

<p>“You see, Hod,” frankly said Hathorn, “Jimmy Potter
drinks occasionally. He has that pretty devil, Dickie
Doubleday, on the string, and he plays high. Now,
my lawyer alone has my Power of Attorney. I can
post our confidential man.</p>

<p>“But, if you would open a special account of, say, a
hundred thousand dollars, why, there is Sugar! There
<a id="png.051" href="#png.051"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>will soon be a ten per cent bonus dividend. You
could see the Street, <em>on the inside</em>! I know that you
would get along with Potter.</p>

<p>“You always were a cool chap. What do you say?
I shall marry Alida VanSittart, and take the run over
the water while I can. I don’t care, however, to lose
Mrs. Willoughby. She is the heaviest woman operator
in America. Her account is a young fortune to
us. Think this over.”</p>

<p>The fine “poker nerve” of Mr. Harold Vreeland was
now manifest in his quick perception of Hathorn’s
trembling fingers. The smoke curled lazily from
Vreeland’s Henry Clay as he said: “I will open my
heart to you, Fred. All my money is already well invested.
And I do not care to move a small block of
my funds. <span class="nw">Besides—</span></p>

<p>“I have been cut off from all phases of womanhood
save the ‘Calamity Jane’ type, or some one’s runaway
wife, for long years. I shall hurry slowly. You
know the Arabic proverb: ‘Hurry is the devil’s.’
Now, by October the first, I will have had my summer
fling. I will perhaps join you then, if you can make
the showing that I would like. But, just now, I am
going in for the ‘roses and raptures.’”</p>

<p>“You are not a marrying man, Hod?” cried Hathorn,
in a sudden alarm.</p>

<p>“Heavens, no!” laughed the Western man. “Omar
Khayyam’s<!-- TN: original reads "Khayam's" --> vision of the ‘Flower Garden’ pales before
the ‘<i lang="fr">embarras de richesse</i>’ of the New York ‘Beauty
Show.’ I am as yet a free lance, and also, an old
campaigner. I will solemnly promise not to marry till
I see you again. But I’ll stand up with you and see
you spliced.”</p>

<p>The compact was sealed over ’tother bottle, and
<a id="png.052" href="#png.052"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>then Hathorn departed in high hopes. “He will drift
easily into our circle,” mused the sly broker, who,
watching only his own loosening hold on Elaine
Willoughby, jumped to the conclusion that Vreeland
really controlled a vast fortune.</p>

<p>His friend had “called the turn” correctly.</p>

<p>“Bluff goes, it seems, even in cold-hearted New
York,” gaily concluded Vreeland, as he sauntered
back alone to the Waldorf. “This strangely hastened
wedding will bring me at once into the best circles.
Mr. Fred Hathorn’s groomsman is a social somebody.
The Lakemere divinity will soon do the rest, and by
the time you return, my sly friend, I will be ready
to kick the ladder down on your side.” He roared
with a secret glee over his own “inability to disturb
his invested funds.”</p>

<p>With a vulpine watchfulness, he noted all Mr. Jimmy Potter’s weak points. “I must get up my
poker practice,” he smilingly said, as he laid his
comely head down to rest.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Potter of New York’ shall reinforce that
slender seven thousand dollars, or else I’m a duffer.
He will never squeal, at least, not to his partner.
And so I’ll go in as a wedge between this ass and this
fine woman who has unconsciously loved him. Yes,
it’s a good opening for a young man! A mean and
easy betrayal!”</p>

<p>The preoccupations of the splendid wedding of Miss
Alida VanSittart gave Vreeland, now “the observed
of all observers,” an ample opportunity to begin that
“silent slavery” of a respectful devotion upon which
he had decided as his safest <i lang="fr">rôle</i> at Lakemere.</p>

<p>His days were pleasantly passed in gaining a growing
intimacy with the club circles to which two
<a id="png.053" href="#png.053"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>51<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>powerful influences had now gained him an easy
access. For, Elaine Willoughby was drifting under the
charm of his apparent self-surrender to her generous
leadership—another handsome protégé.</p>

<p>His rising social star was fixed in its orbit by the
honors of groomsman, and in the <i lang="fr">visites de cérémonie<!-- TN: original reads "céremonie" --></i>,
the rehearsals, and all the petty elegancies of the
“great social event,” Mr. Harold Vreeland showed a
perfectly good form. There was a gentle gravity in
his Waldorf life which impressed even the <i lang="fr">flâneurs<!-- TN: original reads "flaneurs" --></i> of
that gilded hostelry<!-- TN: original reads "hostlery" -->. “There, sir,” remarked an old
habitué<!-- TN" origina;l reads "habitue" -->, “is a man who holds himself at his proper
value.”</p>

<p>Measured and fastidious in all his ways, Mr. Vreeland
neglected no trifling detail, and he calmly went
onward and upward. He well knew that, for some as
yet hidden reason, the bridegroom was assiduously
forcing his old chum forward into the glittering ring
of America’s Vanity Fair. And it exactly suited his
own quiet game.</p>

<p>He fully appreciated the extensive influence of the
Lady of Lakemere, for her friends, moved on deftly by
her, now came forward to open the golden gates for
him on every side.</p>

<p>Even before the wedding, Vreeland had made himself
familiar with all the glories of Lakemere. Side
by side with its beautiful mistress, he had threaded
its leafy alleys, climbed its sculptured heights “when
jocund morn sat on the misty mountain tops,” and
gloated secretly upon the splendid treasures of that
perfect establishment. “This shall be mine yet,” he
swore in his delighted heart.</p>

<p>Out upon the moonlit lake, speeding along in a fairy
launch, Mr. Harold Vreeland followed up his policy
<a id="png.054" href="#png.054"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>52<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of self-abnegation. “Do you not know that I can
trace your noble kindness everywhere?” he murmured.</p>

<p>“I am all alone in the world. Your veiled influence
is making cold-hearted New York smile as a blossoming
paradise for me. No; do not deny it. You are
the very loveliest Queen of Friendship.” The beautiful
brown eyes dropped before his eager gaze. She
was a woman still.</p>

<p>Elaine Willoughby marked him as he went away
with a growing interest. “Graceful, grateful, manly,
and sincere!” was her verdict, easily reached, but one,
however, not so enthusiastically adopted by either
Judge Hiram Endicott or the Conyers couple, whom
the Lady of Lakemere had captured for a visit before
sending them away to the delightful summer exile of
her Adirondack cottage.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what that fellow is after, Hugh?”
growled the old Judge one day, as they were returning
to town together; “but, he looks to me like a
fellow who would finally get it.”</p>

<p>Conyers uneasily said: “He is the ‘head panjandrum’
of this Hathorn wedding—old college chum
and all that.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="la">Arcades ambo!</i>” shortly said the silver-haired
lawyer. “Mrs. Willoughby has a foolish fondness for
picking up these Admirable Crichtons, and then forcing
them along the road to fortune. It is only a
generous woman’s weakness, a sort of self-flattery.”</p>

<p>“Vreeland is immensely rich—a man of leisure.
Has jumped into one or two of the best clubs by
mysterious backing, and seems to be all right,”
slowly answered Hugh, mentally contrasting his own
plain tweeds with Vreeland’s raiment of great price.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word of it,” sharply said Endicott.
<a id="png.055" href="#png.055"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“Oblige me and just keep an eye on him—<em>about her</em>,
I mean,” and the journalist was fain to give the
required promise.</p>

<p>Their hands met in a silent pledge of loyalty to the
lonely-hearted mistress of Lakemere.</p>

<p>The elder man alone knew the silent sorrows of
her anxious soul. He alone knew of the quest of
long years—a labor of love, so far fruitless.</p>

<p>The younger guarded his own heart secret in his
honest breast, and yet, while hiding it from the world,
he wondered why some man worthy of her royal
nature had not taken her to wife.</p>

<p>As the train swept along, watching a “bright,
particular star” mirrored in the flowing Hudson,
Conyers sighed, “God bless her! She’s as far above
me as that star, and yet, she makes my life bright.”</p>

<p>It was Mr. Harold Vreeland who later carried off all
the honors of the sumptuous wedding as a proper
“man-at-arms” in Cupid’s army. He was secretly
approved by even the <i lang="fr">raffinée</i> bridesmaids. He was
also the diplomatic messenger who delivered to Mrs. Alida Hathorn that superb diamond necklace which
was Elaine Willoughby’s bridal offering. Hathorn
remembered after the ceremony how strangely stately
were his lovely patroness’ congratulations to the
radiant bride.</p>

<p>Vreeland’s speech at the Lakemere dinner was
classic in its diction, and when the festivities slowly
crystallized into iridescent memories, and the “happy
pair” were half over to that “bourne” from whence
many American travelers do not return—gay,
glittering Paris—Mr. Harold Vreeland was soon
besieged with many sweetly insidious invitations to
Lenox, Bar Harbor, Narragansett Pier, Newport, the
<a id="png.056" href="#png.056"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>54<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Hudson colony, and many other Capuan bowers of
dalliance.</p>

<p>Larchmont, Lakewood, Irvington, and other summer
mazes opened their hospitable golden gates to him,
and a swarm of biddings to polo, golf, lawn tennis, and
other youthful circles, were gladly offered by man
and maid. In other words, Vreeland was launched
“in the swim.”</p>

<p>In the hurried moments of the steamer parting,
Vreeland would only vouchsafe a cool but diplomatic
answer to Hathorn’s final pleadings.</p>

<p>“I will meet and answer you on October 1st, but
I’ll look in on Potter a bit.”</p>

<p>He did cordially agree to give the bridegroom a
friendly report of all the doings at Lakemere, and he
had fallen heir to Hathorn’s intimacy with Justine—that
spirited French maid, whose many life episodes
had only deprived her of a shadowy candidacy for the
honors of “<i lang="fr">la Rosière</i>.” “I trust to you to look after
my interests, Hod, in a general way,” eagerly said the
bridegroom.</p>

<p>“So I will,” heartily replied the young Lochinvar
<i lang="fr">à la mode</i>, and then he mentally added: “After my
own are safe.” And, so bride and groom sailed away
on the ocean of a newer life.</p>

<p>He so far kept his promise, mindful of the gap
already made by a dash into high life in his seven
thousand dollars, as to closely cement an intimacy
with Potter, begun over the “painted beauties.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hathorn’s bridal wreath had hardly withered
before the astute Vreeland, a good listener, had
become the chief adviser of Potter in his doubtful
warfare with that bright-eyed Cossack of Love, Miss
Dickie Doubleday.</p>

<p><a id="png.057" href="#png.057"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>55<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Mr. Jimmy” now seriously contemplated a two
years’ visit to Europe on the return of the successfully
married Hathorn. “The little rift within the
lute” was widening. Miss Doubleday was as exacting
as she was charming, and even “rosy fetters of
ethereal lightness” were galling to the spoiled child of
fortune. Potter had secretly purchased a Gazetteer
and had made some furtive studies as to Askabad,
Astrachan, Khiva, Timbuctoo, Khartoum, and
several other places where his golden-haired tyrant
could not follow him without due premonition. He
contemplated a “change of base.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will come in with us, Vreeland,”
cordially remarked Potter. “Hathorn tells me that
you are well up in stocks and as quick as lightning.
I wouldn’t mind helping you to an interest. I must
escape this—<span class="nw">this—”</span></p>

<p>The puzzled little millionaire paused, for the first
word was a misfit, and he was a good devil at heart.
He could not abuse the tantalizing Miss Dickie
Doubleday.</p>

<p>With a fine discrimination, the rising social star was
touched with one pang of regret at the little man’s
agony, now impaled on the hook of Miss Dickie
Doubleday’s angle. He visited that bright-eyed
young Ithuriel, and soon effected a “<i lang="la">modus vivendi</i>”
which enabled Potter to cruise around on his yacht for
one month of blessed and unhoped for peace.</p>

<p>In several sittings upon the “Nixie,” Mr. Harold
Vreeland relieved his grateful host of some fourteen
thousand dollars, by the application of the neat little
Western device known as “the traveling aces.”</p>

<p>But, James Potter, grateful to the core, and lulled
<a id="png.058" href="#png.058"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span

 </span></span></a>by the insidious Pommery, never “caught on,” and
cheerfully “cashed up” without a murmur.</p>

<p>From this victorious encounter, Mr. Harold Vreeland
gaily returned to Lakemere, after a brief tour of
inspection of the seaside resorts sacred to the <i lang="es">gente
fina</i>. He found everything “grist to his mill.” The
gates were widely ajar.</p>

<p>With the patient assiduity of a well-conceived purpose,
he now began to make the most of this “one
summer.”</p>

<p>He was well aware, from the reports of the complacent
Justine, that the Conyers were both out of the
way, and his heart bounded with delight as he realized
that Elaine Willoughby gracefully called him to her
side on those four days of the week when Hiram
Endicott was not in commune with her, in the splendid
gray stone mansion bowered in its nodding trees.</p>

<p>He always paid her the delicate compliment of an
implicit obedience, and in all the days of absence
found the way made smooth for him elsewhere.</p>

<p>The circle at Lakemere was a large one, and Mr. Harold Vreeland, “with an equal splendor” and a
touch “impartially tender,” became the favorite <i lang="fr">ami
de maison</i>. He failed not, however, to spread the
balm of his cordial suavity on every side.</p>

<p>Day after day drifted happily by, the unspoken pact
between the new friends becoming a stronger bond
with every week, and the watchful vigilance of the
young adventurer was never relaxed.</p>

<p>He was now grounded on society’s shores as a
fixture, and apparently serenely unconscious, soon
became the <i lang="fr">vogue</i> without effort. The useless accomplishments
of his college days now all came back to
vastly aid the agreeable <i lang="fr">parvenu</i>.</p>

<p><a id="png.059" href="#png.059"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>57<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>He had early mastered the secret of womanhood—the
vague dislike possessed by all of Eve’s charming
daughters for the strong-souled and unyielding
superior man. For, be they never so wary, “trifles
light as air” happily fill up the days of those women to
whom American luxury is both enfeebling and jading.
The strong man is not needed in the feather-ball game
of high life.</p>

<p>That one rare art of the woman-catcher, “never to
bring up, in the faintest degree, the affairs of another
woman,” victoriously carried Vreeland on into the
vacant halls of the <i lang="fr">filles de marbre</i>. And so, “Mr. Harold Vreeland” was universally voted “a charming
man of vast culture and rare accomplishments.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, Mr. Fred Hathorn had widely trumpeted
abroad the Montana bonanza, and the vulgar
slavering over an easily assumed wealth carried him
on both fast and far.</p>

<p>In his own heart, one carefully crystallized plan had
already matured. To reach the innermost holy of
holies of Elaine Willoughby’s heart, and then, to rule
at Lakemere—to secretly lord it later in the
Circassia. With a fine acumen, he refrained from
making a single enemy among her sighing swains or
her fawning women parasites. “They must not
suspect my game here,” he sleekly smiled.</p>

<p>But one brooding shadow hung over the sunshine
of these days. He was always aware of the frequent
visits of Judge Endicott. And Justine’s recitals
proved to him that a hidden sorrow had its seat in her
mistress’ soul.</p>

<p>There were dark days when Elaine Willoughby’s
heart failed under the burden of a past which Vreeland
had never tried to penetrate. She was inaccessible
<a id="png.060" href="#png.060"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>58<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>then. Guarding a perfect silence as to his own
antecedents, he trusted to her in time to unfold to
him the secrets of the heart which he had secretly
sworn to dominate.</p>

<p>“I can be patient. I can afford to wait,” he mused,
as with a faithful assiduity he came and went, and
marked no shadows on the happy dial of those summer
days.</p>

<p>“She is worth serving seven years for,” he mused;
“and, for her fortune—with Lakemere—seventeen.”</p>

<p>“When I am master here,” he secretly exulted, “I
can say: ‘Soul! thou hast much goods!’”</p>

<p>And so he bided his time, and yet, with keen
analysis, decided to make his <i lang="fr">coup</i> before the fretful
and intriguing Hathorn returned.</p>

<p>“It is the one chance of a lifetime,” he mused, as he
paced the lawns of Lakemere. “Once that her social
support would be withdrawn, once that this suspicious
devil, Hathorn, would ‘drop on’ the dangerous game
I am playing, I would be soon ground between the
millstones of fate.”</p>

<p>And his soul was uneasy as the October days
approached and the blue haze of the golden Indian
summer began to drift down the Hudson.</p>

<p>He came to the conclusion at last to put his fate to
the test. For certain letters received from Hathorn
at the Isle of Wight had prepared him for the
explosion of a social bomb which wrecked forever
Frederick Hathorn’s dreams of regaining the alienated
heart of the woman who had led him up the
ladder of life.</p>

<p>And that part of the situation which was seen “as
through a glass darkly” was quickly made clear by
the confidence of a fond woman who had begun to
<a id="png.061" href="#png.061"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>59<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>invest Mr. Harold Vreeland with all the virtues and
many of the graces. Caught on the rebound, her
heart was opening to her artful admirer.</p>

<p>The thorns upon Hathorn’s rosebud were sharp
enough. He already felt the keenness of the petted
Mme. Alida’s egoistic and unruly nature. And, in
a clouded present, he looked back regretfully to a
golden past, with every fear of a stormy future. It
was the old story of two women and one man, with the
poisoned-tongued society intermeddler.</p>

<p>There had been a little happening at the Isle of
Wight which was the direct result of the young
millionaire matron displaying at a yachting ball the
diamond necklace which had been Elaine Willoughby’s
wedding gift. Then, the tongue of envy found its
ready venom.</p>

<p>One of those sleek devils in woman form who are
the social scavengers of the world, had glowered upon
those secretly coveted gems as they rose and fell upon
the bosom of the young moonlight beauty.</p>

<p>She uttered lying words which sent Alida Hathorn
back to her summer cottage with pallid lips and heart
aflame.</p>

<p>The story was soon wafted across the sea by a sister
spider, who had easily followed on the first bitter
quarrel between the two parties to the “marriage of
the year.” And Harold Vreeland, now on post, a
watchful sentinel at Elaine Willoughby’s side, was
the first one to whom her own outraged heart was
poured out, as Mrs. Volney McMorris drove back to
her own lair at Larchmont.</p>

<p>Out in the dreamy gardens, in a summer house, to
the accompaniment of falling leaves and sighing
pines, the indignant lady of Lakemere told her ardent
<a id="png.062" href="#png.062"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>60<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>listener the story of a shameful jealousy and the
outpouring of a maddened woman’s wrath.</p>

<p>It gave to Harold Vreeland the needed cue. The
decisive moment had come, and he hazarded his
future upon the chance of meeting her confidence with
a fine burst of manly sympathy.</p>

<p>To range himself forever under her colors, and to
craftily lie to her, and not in vain.</p>

<p>His audacious devil sprite once more urged him to
be both bold and wise.</p>

<p>Elaine Willoughby’s eyes were flashing as she
repeated the relation of Mrs. Volney McMorris, who,
“so anxious that her dear friend should know all and
not be exposed to the ignominy of a ‘dead cut’ from
Hathorn’s headstrong wife.” “And, as he is a <i lang="fr">lâche</i>,
I would use the ‘baby stare’ first, my dear Elaine,” was
the parting shot of the departing McMorris. The lady
of Lakemere was a roused tigress now.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland listened breathlessly to the story
of the bitter taunt that the diamond necklace and
parting dinner had been Elaine Willoughby’s crafty
“sop to the social Cerberus” in giving her handsome
secret lover, Hathorn, only a furlough for the honeymoon.</p>

<p>The insinuation that the young husband would
carry on a <i lang="fr">ménage à trois</i> had crazed the suspicious
heiress, whose new wedding bonds burned like molten
gold.</p>

<p>“I shall soon know if Frederick Hathorn is an
unutterable craven,” proudly said Elaine to her
serpent listener.</p>

<p>“She has publicly boasted that he shall cease all
semblance of friendship with me, and Mrs. McMorris
told me that Alida had forced every detail of our
<a id="png.063" href="#png.063"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>past intimacy out of her husband, who admitted only
a confidential business relation.</p>

<p>“‘Break it off!’ was Alida’s ultimatum, and she
has publicly declared ‘war to the knife.’</p>

<p>“When Hathorn referred to our business connection,
so profitable to the firm, Alida had cried: ‘I have
money enough for both of us. I married a gentleman,
<em>not a counter jumper</em>! You shall drop all this humbug
business which has been the cloak to your <i lang="fr">amourette</i>.’”</p>

<p>Elaine Willoughby saw the wonderment of Vreeland’s
eyes. With a blush reddening her pale cheek,
she faltered: “The maid overheard the quarrel, and
she told Mrs. McMorris all. She was once her own
attendant.”</p>

<p>“That McMorris is a genius,” mused Vreeland, as
Mrs. Willoughby concluded: “And, Hathorn has
been silent. I have not heard one word from him.”
Her bosom heaved as she gloomily said: “I will
give him a last chance to speak out, and if he acts the
moral coward, then it is <em>war to the knife</em>!</p>

<p>“Her husband’s lady-love! An ex-goddess! ‘A
star on the retired list!’ I will make her pay for
these brutal vulgarities! I will force him to speak,
and in her presence!”</p>

<p>The artful Mr. Harold Vreeland fancied that he
had discovered the reason of the storms of sorrow
which had swept over the lady of Lakemere. He
knew not of Endicott’s bootless quest for a message
from the misty shores of the past. “<em>These two women
foes will decide my fate!</em>” he quickly decided. “Here
is the place to leap into the breach and widen it.”</p>

<p>Taking Elaine Willoughby’s trembling hands in his
own, he fixed his ardent eyes upon her, and once
<a id="png.064" href="#png.064"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>62<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>more her glances fell under the spell of his steady
gaze.</p>

<p>His voice had the ring of sincerity in it as he proceeded
with a feigned reluctance.</p>

<p>“You need not wait, Madonna!” Mr. Vreeland had
easily reached the stage of a special appellation for
the Queen of the Street.</p>

<p>“He has already spoken, and I will fight in this
good cause—to the death, under your colors.”</p>

<p>He drew out a letter from Hathorn and read it
slowly, without a single comment, and with a dramatic,
hushed solemnity.</p>

<p>Before he had finished he saw in her glowing eyes
that she was his prey. The poisoned arrow had struck
home. She was, after all, a woman at heart.</p>

<p>Hathorn’s jerky letter referred to the “end of the
season,” “a return <i lang="it">incognito</i>,” and demanded an
early meeting with his chum. “I presume that you
know all of Potter’s troubles. He wants to become
a ‘special partner,’ and then to go away for two
years. You must join us at once, or I must find
another man. So, have your answer ready.” Elaine
Willoughby was silent until Vreeland slowly read:</p>

<p>“I count on you to control in future Mrs. Willoughby’s
business. Make yourself her friend and
confidant. My wife is a tiger-cat of jealousy. Some
fools or fiends have been working upon her spoiled
babyhood. I’ve vainly told her that the woman
whom she hates was past her youth and old enough
to be her mother; but she will listen to no reason.</p>

<p>“Now, old fellow, you can easily gain Mrs. Willoughby’s good will. Her account is the best on
the Street, and, in this way, if you join us, we can
divide the profits, and I am then safe from a fruitless
<a id="png.065" href="#png.065"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>63<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>quarrel. Of course, I’ve got to drop the Willoughby
for good.”</p>

<p>There was a shrill cry of rage and defiance. Vreeland’s
heart leaped up.</p>

<p>“Let me read the rest of that <em>alone</em>,” cried Elaine,
with blazing eyes. After a moment’s pause, she
handed it back, when she had noted Hathorn’s signature.</p>

<p>“He asks you to cable him your decision!” breathlessly
said the Queen of the Street.</p>

<p>“I have simply telegraphed: ‘<em>Impossible! I decline!</em>’”
answered Vreeland, and then, in the silence the shade
of Judas Iscariot laughed far down in hell.</p>

<p>Their hands met in a silent pledge of a friendship
which shone in Elaine Willoughby’s misty eyes.
“<em>How can I thank you?</em>” she began; but gravely
Harold Vreeland addressed her to her growing
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Wait!” he said, with a seeming reluctance. “I
never would have shown you that letter but to save
your own noble soul from the humiliation of stooping
to a conference with a man who would so meanly
trade upon your past bounty and try to trap you,
through me. Your confidence has brought this out.
But, you must hear all. I claim no credit for declining
to be the man to hoodwink you. ‘The pleasant
days of Aranjuez’ are waning fast. I am soon going
to leave New York and go back to the great West.”</p>

<p>Vreeland noted the quick, convulsive start, and his
heart rejoiced as she grasped his hands, whispering:
“Never! My one faithful knight shall stay here <em>near
me</em> to battle in my defense, ‘even if I am old enough
to be Alida Hathorn’s mother.’ Tell me all. It is
my right now to know all your plans.”</p>

<p><a id="png.066" href="#png.066"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>64<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The handsome adventurer raised his grave face to
her own. “I will, if you will promise me to ignore
these two people—the hollow-hearted man who
would use me to entrap you, and that saucy girl, a
spoiled child from her cradle. Hathorn carries his
own future punishment around with him in that crisp
bundle of dimity.”</p>

<p>The unspoken pledge of her eyes told him that his
<i lang="fr">coup</i> had succeeded. “By Jove!” he mused, “she is
only a woman, like the rest. The taunt as to her age
has cut her deeper than this fellow’s rank ingratitude.”</p>

<p>He gazed upon her Indian summer beauty, and his
eyes strayed away to the pillared glories of the
matchless country mansion. “She’s worth the risk—with
Lakemere,” he reflected. “I’ll try it!” He
yielded and spoke, and she listened with tender eyes.</p>

<p>And the shadows deepened around them, as the
young schemer told a plaintive story of emotional
lying embroidery to the woman whose agitated heart
was swept with a storm of revengeful feeling.</p>

<p>A passionate desire to punish the younger woman
whose husband had used the mean taunt of her sunset
years to quiet the jealous little spitfire heiress.</p>

<p>“I did not come to New York City under false
pretenses,” began Vreeland, “but, Hathorn has taken
me wrongly to be a rich man. I am only a poor man
to-day, and a weary and a lonely life lies before me.”</p>

<p>“I could not muster the hundred thousand dollars
needed to go into their firm, for I have made myself
poor in the discharge of a sacred duty.”</p>

<p>With a fine affectation of manly earnestness, he then
told the generous-hearted woman a romantic tale of
his gifted father’s career, and of the death of his
<a id="png.067" href="#png.067"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>65<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>patient mother. He judiciously unfolded the story of
his father’s professional errors, and painted that
“sudden taking off” in the wilds of Montana.</p>

<p>A knowledge of Judge Endicott’s encyclopedic
memory, and some previous hints from the wary
Justine, caused Vreeland to put in a hidden plea in
bar, to offset any private researches of the only two
men whom he feared in Elaine’s glittering entourage.
They were the silver-haired Hiram Endicott and the
manly Conyers.</p>

<p>Once or twice he had observed the latter’s eyes
searching him in no unmeaning hostility.</p>

<p>There were tears on Elaine Willoughby’s lashes as
he concluded with manly earnestness:</p>

<p>“Left with a supposedly ample fortune, I found, on
an examination of my father’s private papers, that
there was before me a sacred task of restitution.
A work of self-abnegation, of simple honesty, lay
before me.</p>

<p>“I had never known of the baleful influence of the
woman who led my father (once in her clutches) on to
lead a double life.</p>

<p>“But, in justice to his own better self and in honor
of my beloved mother’s memory, I gave up nearly
all, and so arrived here with only a few thousand
dollars in my pocket.”</p>

<p>The shades had deepened around them when he concluded
with his last master stroke of manly simplicity.</p>

<p>“Chance threw me across Hathorn in the train as
I came here to collect the only honest money left to
me after my work of secret restitution was done. I
saw that he valued only money—success—and the
glitter of your hot-hearted swell circles.</p>

<p>“It was hard for me to dishonor a father’s memory.
<a id="png.068" href="#png.068"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>66<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>To undeceive my old college friend, I intended to
ask him later for aid—for employment. But I soon
saw that I would not get it. He fell into the
innocent error of supposing me to be very rich.</p>

<p>“And,” the young special pleader rose as he said,
under his voice, “<em>I met you there—at the depot!</em> My
heart and soul craved another sight of you. And
that I might meet you again, <em>I did not undeceive him</em>.</p>

<p>“You know the rest. I have been true to you, and
I have given up my last hope of fortune in refusing
to be his tool.”</p>

<p>He could see her splendid eyes shining upon him
through her happy tears.</p>

<p>“Let us go in, Harold,” she softly said. “I must
think! I must think! But promise me that you will
not go away from New York till I bid you. Trust to
me.”</p>

<p>“I promise,” he gravely said, as he lifted her
trembling hand and kissed it, and then, arm in arm,
they wandered back to her splendid pleasaunce palace.
<em>It</em> was the “betrayal with a kiss.”</p>

<p>After the dinner, to which a few of the nearest
county magnates had been previously bidden, Vreeland
watched Elaine’s imperial bearing as she proudly
queened it in the drawing room.</p>

<p>A richer rose burned upon her cheek. Her eyes
were lit up with a strange fire, and her magnificent
voice echoed in every heart with a thrill of a quivering
life, as her defiant soul rose to the prelude of that
coming war with the jealous girl who had determined
to shine down the Lady of Lakemere.</p>

<p>The last carriage load of guests had rattled away,
and Mme. Lafarge, wearied “<i lang="fr">dame de compagnie</i>,” was
nodding, with her eyes hopefully fixed upon the old
<a id="png.069" href="#png.069"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>colonial hall clock, when Elaine said, softly: “One
last word with you in the library.”</p>

<p>The Queen of the Street stood there with downcast
eyes before the great carved mantle, as she slowly
said: “They will arrive in three or four days. You
must confirm your answer to him.</p>

<p>“He has told me that you know stocks, and are
familiar with all board matters.”</p>

<p>Vreeland bowed in silence.</p>

<p>“Then,” she said, fixing her sparkling eyes upon
him, “I will make you a confession. I had decided to
withdraw gradually my entire business from their
firm. In fact, I have been already secretly operating
through a trusted friend <em>on the outside</em>.</p>

<p>“You must find a good man, one acceptable to
Hiram Endicott.</p>

<p>“I will set you up, and Hathorn &amp; Potter shall soon
find a rival. I will carry the war into the enemy’s
camp. So be on your guard. <em>Hathorn must never
know!</em></p>

<p>“It is the only punishment for his abandonment at
the first hostile signal from his enraged wife. I have
made him on the Street! <em>I can unmake him!</em>” Her
voice had the ring of a singing bugle calling to arms.<!-- TN: extraneous double quote removed --></p>

<p>“But, I have no money,” the crafty Judas faltered.</p>

<p>“Leave that to me,” laughingly said Elaine. “You
are now my own knight. Here are your colors.”</p>

<p>She handed him a knot of ribbon blue. “Come to
me next week. Meet him frankly and decline all
connection. Senator Alynton will be here then.”</p>

<p>And she smiled and pressed a rosy finger to her lips.</p>

<p>“The Sugar magnate!” whispered the happy Vreeland,
as he stood spellbound, while his goddess fled up
the stair, leaving him there alone.</p>

<p class="chaphead">“WYMAN AND VREELAND” SWING THE STREET.</p>


<p>Mr. Harold Vreeland was awake with the birds, and
in an early morning walk long communed with himself
under the whispering trees of Lakemere. The
enchanting prospect of the superb estate delighted his
eyes more with every visit. He blessed the goddess
Fortune, and smiled truly, “the lines have fallen to
me in pleasant places!”</p>

<p>It was only with a severe struggle that he concealed
the secret joy now burning in his heart, and he carefully
laid out all his plans for the crucial week to
come. He must widen the breach.</p>

<p>There was the conference with Senator Alynton,
Hiram Endicott, and that strange “big brother,” Hugh
Conyers. He felt instinctively that these three men
would not share “Madonna’s” enthusiasm.</p>

<p>He aimed to continually efface himself and to allow
the resentful woman to goad herself along in the path
of social and financial revenge.</p>

<p>“Any fool can stand hard times, but it takes a wise
man to keep his head, under a run of winning luck!”
he mused, with reminiscences of “Mr. John Oakhurst”
and his pithy proverb, that “the luck usually
got tired—before the man did.”</p>

<p>He retraced his steps to the house, and was most
calmly quiescent and tenderly respectful in his adieu.</p>

<p>“That burst of confidence has fixed her—<em>for good</em>!”
he mused.</p>

<p><a id="png.071" href="#png.071"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“You are to report to me, here, by letter, the result
of your interview with that man!” hurriedly whispered
Elaine Willoughby, as her “knight” turned toward the
wagonette. “I will summon you here, when Alynton
comes. Do nothing else. Leave all to me.” And
his eyes burned into her soul, as he promised a happy
slave’s obedience.</p>

<p>The bright smile of the dark-eyed enthusiast haunted
him all the way to New York. “Talleyrand was right,”
he murmured, at ease in the parlor car, “<i lang="fr">Point de
zèle!</i> She will make all the running for me.” He
enjoyed the salutations showered right and left on
him, as the train picked up the men of note carrying
the hopes and fears of a new week to Gotham. “I
am a somebody now!” he grinned.</p>

<p>The rising light of the Sentinel and Locust clubs,
the man who had superbly engineered the brilliant
Hathorn-VanSittart’s nuptials—“the great Montana
capitalist,” was surely a man of mark, and Nature’s
easy gifts had earned him a warm welcome in the
slightly jaded circles of the Four Hundred. He was,
moreover, a “new face,” and several spasms of unrest
under aristocratic corsages had already proved that
there were eyes “which brightened when he came.”</p>

<p>As for his false <i lang="fr">rôle</i> of man of leisure and <i lang="fr">élégant</i>—“custom
of it, had made a property of easiness.” “I
am a fraud—and—half these anæmic swells are fools
as well as frauds!—I am content!” he smilingly
decided, as he reviewed his plans for a daring course
during the next trying week.</p>

<p>As he had surmised, a telegram awaited him at the
Waldorf from the returned Hathorn. It was of a
simple directness.</p>

<p>“Meet me to-night, seven. Old York Club. Must
<a id="png.072" href="#png.072"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>70<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>have your answer reconsidered. Every inducement
possible.” The subtle smile of triumph which played
around his lips recalled Private Ortheri’s stern remark,
“See that beggar—got him!”—as he dropped the
faraway Pathan with the “long shot.”</p>

<p>All day, Frederick Hathorn secretly tormented himself
over the curt answer, “Will be there. Vreeland.”
There was much before the tortured bridegroom to
arrange. The mutinous Dickie Doubleday, phantom
of audacious and unrestful beauty, was now driving
Mr. James Potter out of his wits.</p>

<p>He longed for a “boat upon the shore and a bark
upon the sea!” He had learned that in some distant
Afghan hole called “Swat,” there were neither post-offices,
telegraphs, banks, detectives, song and dance
theatres, nor any of the machinery of a “bastard civilization”
which the reckless Miss Dickie could work to
ensnare or follow him.</p>

<p>“By Gad! Just the place! I’ll get a white shirt—brown
myself up like parched coffee, and turn into a
Ghazi, or Dervish, or fighting Mollah—or, any old
thing. She is a hummer. Pray God, that some other
good-looking fellow will soon catch her ‘wandering
eye.’ Her constancy is an ‘abnormal feature’ of later
development. This is the only time in her life that
she has stuck to a victim—for over three months.
Other fellows should help me bear the burden.”</p>

<p>There was all the details of Hathorn’s newly enhanced
social state to arrange. The Union and
Metropolitan clubs were to be haunt of Benedick—the
married man. And—the war to the knife, the fight
of Marius and Sylla now lay before him.</p>

<p>There was Oakwood, his wife’s magnificent place at
Ashmont, awaiting its social <i lang="fr">monture</i>. Her Imperious
<a id="png.073" href="#png.073"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>71<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Ladyship Alida had ordered him to go in for the pennant-bearing
honors of Vice Commodore of the
Ashmont Yacht Club, and her beautiful schooner,
“L’Allouette,” was awaiting his practical hand.</p>

<p>A positive mandate for the best box at the Horse
Show, and a royal gallery box in the tiara-wearing tier
of the Opera, were matters of pressing urgency.</p>

<p>Hathorn was already “broken in” as a “general
advance agent” and “heavy man” for his wife’s
“Great Moral Matrimonial Show,” and that lady,
with the coming Hathorn-Willoughby feud first in her
mind, had brought luggage enough for Cleopatra and
all her nymphs on that record-breaking voyage of
splendor to the Cydnus.</p>

<p>All these and many more things busied the disgruntled
Hathorn until the hour set for the meeting
with Vreeland. He had posted his wife and her train
away up to the Buckingham, for he felt, instinctively,
that the handsome groomsman was not just the party
to linger around his newly-enclosed sheepfold.</p>

<p>He had already discovered several shades of color in
his rosebud not visible to the ante-nuptial eye, and,
moreover, he was hungry for news of Elaine Willoughby
and of her state of mind. He now saw
the “firm’s” interests seriously endangered.</p>

<p>There was the vastly profitable past business connection,
and “Sugar,” too, loomed up before him now
as a vanishing pyramid of alluring sweetness. He
knew that the woman whom he had coldly left had
been the very spirit of his own wonderful success.</p>

<p>But Hathorn never knew how eagerly Vreeland, at
the Waldorf, his anxiety veiled by a thoughtful smile,
watched the clock hands crawl around till seven.</p>

<p>“That fool has but one chance left to ruin me
<a id="png.074" href="#png.074"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>72<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>forever—and—to block my little game!” restlessly reflected
Vreeland. “If he only had the manly nerve to dash
up to Lakemere and to throw himself there on Elaine’s
generosity, he might be forgiven—even now. The
swaying bosom of womanhood is always ripe for forgiveness.
A woman is fondly weak to a man who
calls up a lost love. And he has been all in all to her,
in the past days.</p>

<p>“She set him up on a high pedestal and fairly worshiped
him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he felt like the Frenchman, that two
women are necessary to every man—one whom he
loves, and one who loves him.”</p>

<p>But the telegraphed reports of his secret spies arriving
every half hour, told the delighted Vreeland that
Hathorn was still “at the office.”</p>

<p>“Give me to-night, and just one telegram to reach
the Madonna—then—I will have made that breach
irrevocable!” gleefully cried Vreeland, as he was
driven down to the Old York Club.</p>

<p>The two men met in an apparent cordiality, and the
Western man’s poker nerve stood by him, as he calmly
enjoyed a dinner, at which Hathorn merely nibbled,
with an ill-concealed restlessness.</p>

<p>They exhausted all the usual banalities with regard
to the well-beaten paths of the wedding tour, and Mr. Vreeland was graceful in all his perfunctory interest
in the young Adam and Eve in their newly found
Paradise.</p>

<p>When the cigars and liqueurs brought them around to
the “hard-pan” stage of the interview, and a guarded
seclusion, with a slow constrained manner—Frederick
Hathorn began to carefully interrogate the “devil
whom he had let out of the bottle.”</p>

<p><a id="png.075" href="#png.075"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>73<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Vreeland keenly eyed the speaker through the blue-curling
smoke of a Henry Clay, and, when Hathorn
had reviewed all his past arguments as to the proposed
business connection, he buried his head in his hands
in deep thought.</p>

<p>Hathorn had even offered to aid Vreeland with the
capital to qualify him as a member of the projected
firm of “Hathorn, Potter &amp; Vreeland.” It was a
clear “giveaway” of his temporizing fears of the
coming war.</p>

<p>“You see, you could swing Mrs. Willoughby’s
account and give it your special attention,” concluded
the man who had now shown every card in his hand.</p>

<p>Hathorn noticed, with a growing uneasiness, that
Vreeland had been very reticent. The “Montana
capitalist” had grown pompously solemn.</p>

<p>Suddenly his old college chum lifted his head, and
frankly eyed the anxious banker. “Have you conferred
with Mrs. Willoughby on this plan?” he said,
curtly. It was pinning his dupe to the cross—this sly
thrust.</p>

<p>Hathorn stammered, as he reddened, “Why—no! I
have left that all to you. I have not written her nor
seen her, since the wedding dinner. The fact is—” and
the alert man of the world was left strangely searching
for words which seemed to die away on his lips.
He dared not betray his wife’s orders.</p>

<p>“I may as well say frankly,” impressively remarked
Vreeland, “and, right here—once for all, that I can
not enter your firm. I have made other plans. The
thing you propose is impossible. I am sorry—but it
is <em>impossible</em>.”</p>

<p>“How does Mrs. Willoughby look at it? I thought
that you were getting on splendidly there?” feebly
<a id="png.076" href="#png.076"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>74<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>urged Hathorn, conscious that he was very rapidly
slipping “down hill.”</p>

<p>There was a fine show of regret in Vreeland’s speaking
eyes, as he slowly answered, “My dear boy! You
have made the mistake of your life. There are some
very ugly social rumors current in my clubs—” he
paused, “more in sorrow than in anger.”</p>

<p>“And those stories wafted over the sea do not lose by
the telling. I have refrained from even mentioning
your name, or that of your wife, to Mrs. Willoughby
since this petticoat cabal has taken up the subject of
the impending social war. Women’s unbridled tongues
are the furies’ whip-lashes.”</p>

<p>Hathorn sprang up in excitement. “By Jove! Hod!
I look to you to tell me the whole miserable business.
I’ve taken you up and worked you in at Lakemere.
You have got to stand by me now.”</p>

<p>“Hold on! Stop right there,”<!-- TN: original has period --> coldly remarked
Vreeland, with a vicious gleam in his stony eyes. “I
never mention a woman’s name. That is a point of
honor with me. I am no club scavenger.</p>

<p>“You know what you owe to Elaine Willoughby.
She was the architect of <em>your</em> fortunes. Perhaps she
builded better than she knew.</p>

<p>“You can not face the situations publicly. I advise
you to keep silent—and—<em>to keep others silent</em>.</p>

<p>“Now, beyond that I will not go. I feel that your
references to me, and what you have done for me,
authorize me to say that I have more than repaid
you in the volunteer labors of your wedding.</p>

<p>“Once for all, let us drop Mrs. Willoughby. I will
not, in any way, take sides in this unfortunate affair,
save to silently cleave to the Lady of Lakemere,
through good and evil report.</p>

<p><a id="png.077" href="#png.077"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>75<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“If you dare not face her, if you have abandoned her
to the mercies of the pack of be-diamonded old ghouls
who are slandering her, you know, of course, that
you will close the door of your house to every friend
of hers.” The bridegroom was cornered—and his
heart was filled with a sullen despair.</p>

<p>Hathorn strode up and down the room in a white
rage. He paused, at last, before Vreeland, and then,
in a choking voice, said: “I must ask you to return
my last confidential letter.”</p>

<p>Vreeland calmly moved toward the door. “I am a
free man—am I not?” he quietly said. “I believe a
letter is the property of the party to whom addressed
when regularly delivered through the mail. When
you divide the clans of society you will find me—<em>on
the other side</em>.</p>

<p>“And, as my time is of value, you will now excuse
me. Don’t force me to tell Potter, whom I respect,
that you only wanted to use me as a stool pigeon to
entrap the woman who has made you what you are—a
solid man—in Wall Street!”</p>

<p>With a mad impulse, Hathorn sprang to the door.</p>

<p>“No! by Jove! No row here!” he muttered, and
when he sauntered downstairs with an assumed carelessness,
his guest had departed.</p>

<p>There was a “lively interlude in married life”
transacted late that evening “behind closed doors,”
at the Buckingham, in which Mr. Frederick Hathorn,
for the second time that evening, suffered a sore
defeat, and “went below” to seek the consolation of
Otard-Dupuy &amp; Co.’s very ripe old pale cognac.</p>

<p>That bright-eyed falcon, Alida Hathorn, then and
there ran up the red flag of “War to the Knife”—and
“No Surrender!”</p>

<p><a id="png.078" href="#png.078"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>76<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>But the jubilant Harold Vreeland slept not till he
had personally, at Broadway and Twenty-third
Street, sent off an urgent dispatch to Lakemere. “I
think that reads strongly enough,” chuckled Vreeland,
as he gazed on the words.</p>

<p class="quote">“He played the craven. Wanted me to give him secret reports
of your affairs, and then demanded his letters back. All relations
are permanently broken off. Will guard absolute silence.”</p>

<p>It was at his leisurely breakfast in the Palm
Garden, the next morning, that Vreeland, with a
wildly-beating heart, tore open “Madonna’s” answering
message.</p>

<p>He stifled the cry of exultation which rose to his
lips, for the Rubicon was passed. It was really now
“<i lang="es">Guerra à cuchillo!</i>”</p>

<p>Elaine Willoughby’s words were replete with that
<i lang="la">fortiter in re</i> which the unlucky Hathorn was destined
later to realize. He only knew her <i lang="la">suaviter in modo</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Ignore him. Be ready to report when I call you.
Party from Washington expected in three days. Stand
to your colors!</i>” The signature, “<i>True Blue</i>,” was a
reminder of their secret pact.</p>

<p>“I think, Mr. Frederick Hathorn, that I have you
‘dead to rights’ now,” mused Vreeland, who determined
that the “social war” should blaze up fiercely,
but without his hand at the bellows.</p>

<p>A round of calls in the next three days proved to
him that Mrs. Alida Hathorn had harked back on all
the old intimacy of the unhappy bridegroom, and was
diligently sowing broadcast the Cadmus teeth of
merciless and pointed satire upon the “sunset beauty
on the retired list.” “<em>A woman old enough to be my
mother!</em>”</p>

<p>When appealed to by many bright-eyed <i lang="it">banditti</i>,
<a id="png.079" href="#png.079"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>77<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Mr. Harold Vreeland merely sadly shook his head in
a vague deprecation. “I know nothing whatever,”
he softly sighed. “All this sudden gossip is Greek to
me, Greek of Cimmerian darkness.”</p>

<p>In the two clubs which he most affected, Vreeland—in
a manly burst of platform oratory—when appealed
to by eager quidnuncs—sternly announced his code.</p>

<p>“I never take a woman’s name on my lips in gossip.
I know nothing, I have heard nothing—and—excuse
me—I will listen to nothing. Both the ladies are
valued friends of mine.” He was voted a “thoroughbred.”</p>

<p>But, in his craven heart, he rejoiced at the rapid
spreading of the war. Knowing that Hathorn would
watch him, he avoided lower New York until after
Madame Elaine Willoughby had made one brief
downtown visit for a serious consultation with her
agent, Endicott.</p>

<p>With a well-judged cautionary wisdom, he also
avoided the “Circassia,” which was, indeed, watched
by Hathorn’s spies, and he grinned with delight when
his growing band of friends re-echoed his own skillfully
planted suggestion of a winter trip to Europe.</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> thinking of an extended tour,” he frankly
admitted, and he soon knew that this had reached the
humiliated Hathorn, for James Potter, Esq., in a personal
visit, urged Vreeland to join him in that memorable
expedition to “Swat,” which was to throw the
<i lang="fr">mutine</i> Miss Dickie Doubleday forever “off the
track.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a carte blanche as my guest, Vreeland,”
laughed Potter. “You can take anybody you
want on my yacht—<em>save only that bright-eyed devil,
Dickie</em>.”</p>

<p><a id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>78<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>It was evident Hathorn had not “blabbed,” for
Potter gaily said: “I don’t blame you for keeping
out of business. Lucky dog that you are—Hathorn
has got a first-class man, Renard Wolfe, to go in as
active, and I relapse into a special partner—but we
would have sooner had you.”</p>

<p>When Vreeland hastened back to Lakemere, in
answer to a laconic dispatch, “<i>Come up at once</i>,” he
knew of the increasing bitterness of the impending
war. Mrs. Willoughby, riding through Pine Street,
had given her one-time protégé Hathorn the dead
cut, before a dozen magnates of Wall and Broad, to
their open-eyed amazement.</p>

<p>Every broker on the Street was now eager to snap
up “the Willoughby’s” business, and Mr. James
Potter, abstracting a “Gaiety Girl” from an inchoate
visiting troupe, had hastily set sail for “Swat,” via
the Suez canal, with a little <i lang="fr">partie carrée</i> to avoid a
storm of queries—couched with “Say, old fellow, what
the old Harry’s all this rumpus between the Hathorns
and your ‘star’ customer?”</p>

<p>The placid Potter, far out beyond Fire Island,
delightedly left the “high contracting parties” to
fight it out between them, <i lang="fr">à<!-- TN: original has "a" --> la mode de Kilkenny</i>.</p>

<p>And, the wonder grew as the golden letters
“Hathorn, Wolfe &amp; Co.” soon took the place of the
conquering device, “Hathorn &amp; Potter,” over the
door of the booth in Mammon’s mart where Elaine
Willoughby’s helping hand had built up the fortune
of the ingrate protégé.</p>

<p>The handsome Vreeland was light-hearted as he
approached Lakemere, for he was pondering over a
letter of special invitation received to a <i lang="fr">diner de
cérémonie<!-- TN: original reads "céremonie" --></i> to emphasize the reopening of Mrs. Alida
<a id="png.081" href="#png.081"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>79<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Hathorn’s superb Fifth Avenue mansion, a patrimonial
hereditament gloriously embourgeoned for that winter
social campaign in which Mrs. Alida proposed to
crush “that woman Willoughby.”</p>

<p>The young matron had taken the bit between her
teeth and was boldly rallying all her clans, with a
fine social programme adapted to both attract the
“outer woman,” and charm the “inner man.”</p>

<p>Vreeland’s courteous declination of the dinner on
the ground of “his impending departure,” had caused
Mrs. Alida to dispatch the energetic Mrs. Volney
McMorris to glean from Vreeland, in an artfully contrived
“chance interview” at the Waldorf, all these
details of the sudden estrangement which the bride
of a few months could not extract from the morose
Hathorn.</p>

<p>But, always sedate and sly, Vreeland brought all
his batteries to bear on the double-faced Madame
Janus, who had already earned a diamond bracelet by
her Vidocq operations from Hathorn’s reckless wife.</p>

<p>The “McMorris Investigating Committee” was a
flat failure. Vreeland—a glib liar—“voiced his
yearning” for London and its extensive jungles replete
with the social lion, alive or stuffed.</p>

<p>He gracefully glided out of the buxom gossip’s
snares and bore off a full account of Alida Hathorn’s
plans, and a true relation of that encounter in the
leafy mazes of Central Park, where the watchful Mrs. Elaine Willoughby, from the citadel of her victoria,
froze the beautiful Mrs. Hathorn with a pointed
ignoring of the woman whose “wedding dinner” had
been the vaunt of Lakemere.</p>

<p>The fortuitous presence of Senator David Alynton,
with his secret partner, the Queen of the Street—the
<a id="png.082" href="#png.082"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>80<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>astonishment of that lovely blonde patrician, Mrs. Mansard Larue, the companion of Hathorn’s imprudent
wife, had given the news of the “incident” to all
the gentlewomen in Gotham, as well as to clubdom.</p>

<p>Messrs. Merriman, Wiltshire and Rutherstone, in a
noisy cabal at the Old York Club, waylaid every
“good knight and true,” until, when their discussion
had reached its height, the accidental incoming of
Hathorn brought about a strained and solemn hush,
in which “the beating of their own hearts was all
the sound they heard.”</p>

<p>With a whitening face, Hathorn sped away to the
Fifth Avenue fortress of the VanSittart tribe, to angrily
demand, “What new tomfoolery is on the tapis?”
while the three young buzzards of the club spread the
news that “the battle is on—once more—” and then,
gaily whetted their youthful beaks accordingly upon
the succulent elephantine tips of their “sticks.”</p>

<p>Eager leopards of the “society journals” lurking in
that dim penumbra between “the high tin gods” and
the “toilers of New York,” seized upon the garbled
details and, with rending sarcasm, and thinly varnished
innuendo, hinted that the “first blood and
knock-down” of this finish fight were to be credited to
that remarkably knowing matron, Madame Elaine
Willoughby, of Lakemere.</p>

<p>“It has gone on too far ever to be healed, this breach
between the sundered hearts,” delightedly decided
the buoyant Vreeland, as he stepped out of the train
at Irvington. “All I have to do now, is not to cross
my own luck.”</p>

<p>He was startled as, when about to enter the wagonette,
a village lad on watch shyly bade him walk into
the ladies’ waiting room, where the adroit Justine
<a id="png.083" href="#png.083"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>81<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was waiting for him with tidings of moment. Mr. Harold Vreeland had won the caoutchouc heart of the
piercing-eyed French soubrette by his golden largesse.
He had learned the importance of “parting freely”
when it was to his profit, and several hundred dollars
of Jimmy Potter’s poker money had already enlarged
the growing hoard with which Justine proposed to buy
a neat cabaret in Paris and set up a bull-throated
gamin whom she resolutely adored.</p>

<p>“Be on your guard!” Justine whispered. “Mr. Hathorn has just now tried to bribe me to watch
you and Mrs. Willoughby. He has tormented Doctor
Hugo Alberg, also. The Doctor is my friend,”
modestly admitted Justine, with the deference of
dropped eyes to her imperiled “character.”</p>

<p>“I have been down at New York arranging the
‘Circassia’ for our home-coming. Hathorn has
offered Doctor Alberg anything to bring him once
more accidentally into Mrs. Willoughby’s presence.</p>

<p>“He came up yesterday to Lakemere—and yet
Madame absolutely declined to see him, and so she
returned his card. And, to the old lawyer, <i lang="fr">ce brav’
vieux<!-- TN: original reads "ce brav 'vieux" --></i> Endicott, he, too, has made the call—‘to
demand a hearing’—as an old friend.</p>

<p>“I heard Madame and the Judge talking. And
now—to-day—there are the Senator, the journalist,
Monsieur Conyers, and the Judge Endicott all day
in the library with Madame. So, <i lang="fr">mon ami</i>, beware!”</p>

<p>The fifty-dollar bill which Vreeland pressed into her
hand was an inspirational piece of good judgment,
and Gallic prayers from a too-inflammable heart followed
him as he darted away to the wagonette.</p>

<p>“I will back the Queen of Hearts to win!” mused
the vigilant Vreeland, as he arranged his “society
<a id="png.084" href="#png.084"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>82<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>face” for that watchful and nonchalant repose which
totally disarmed the three men whom he met at
dinner.</p>

<p>There was not an awkward undercurrent of import
to the evening in which Harold Vreeland, forewarned
and forearmed, knew that he was always “under fire”—that
greatest test of nerve—simply bidden to “stand
fast and wait for orders.”</p>

<p>He watched the “casement’s glimmering square”
long after the house was still, slowly revolving his
crafty plans, and as yet ignorant of the day’s secret
council so vital to his future career.</p>

<p>He knew not of the sympathetic silence of Conyers,
his fine intellectual face hidden in a window’s shadow,
while Endicott had frankly related all that he had
known unfavorable of the late Erastus Vreeland,
Attorney and Counselor at Law, Solicitor in Equity,
and Proctor in Admiralty.</p>

<p>Senator David Alynton, remembering that the
owners of the “Clarion” also owned a good-sized
block of “Sugar,” and were the secret press agents of
the Trust, tried earnestly to obtain an opinion from
the taciturn Conyers. “I know nothing whatever of
this man,” gallantly answered the writer. “This
thing seems to me to be like a marriage—in which
the seal of the bond goes on before anything definite
is known of the parties’ real character.”</p>

<p>The formation of a new firm to handle the business
lost by Hathorn’s sudden and egoistic plunge into
matrimony was the matter under discussion.</p>

<p>“It seems to me, Madame,” said the sagacious
Alynton, “that if you intend to put this young man
into such a place of grave trust, there should be
another partner, provided, one acceptable to our side,
<a id="png.085" href="#png.085"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>83<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and—if possible—one known to me. And we must
not, moreover, have a mere tyro. I should like to
approve one name in the new firm—if you select the
other.”</p>

<p>“Be it so,” gravely said the Lady of Lakemere.
“I will only say for Mr. Vreeland, that I know all
of the secrets of the life of his late unfortunate
father, and of the son’s manly actions in closing up all
his father’s scattered affairs. I will back him with all
the money needed, and, also, guarantee his good
faith, provided he alone controls such ‘private business’
as is handled through me. Judge Endicott has
told me nothing new of the elder Vreeland. I think
I can suggest a plan to find the other man whom we
want, or else a firm already in existence, which will
commend itself to you, Senator. Let us advertise,
guardedly, for a partner.”</p>

<p>With a sigh, Hiram Endicott drew Conyers out of
the room, and while Senator Alynton yielded to the
dark-eyed lady’s most ingenious plan, the old lawyer,
under the trees, dejectedly said, “Conyers! there is
again the woman enigma! A woman with heart certainly
needs no head. And—a woman with a head
should be heartless.</p>

<p>“The one can only be happy in being deluded, it
seems—and the other can be properly left to coldly play
the game of life in safety—and then smile at her dupes.
This dear woman, unfortunately, has <em>both</em> head and
heart, and so, <em>she must suffer</em>.</p>

<p>“This young fellow’s fine eyes have done the business—his
mellow, pleading voice carries the day. To be
first favorite—vice Hathorn, discharged—Vreeland,
promoted from the ranks!”</p>

<p>While Senator David Alynton, a cool, gray-eyed
<a id="png.086" href="#png.086"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>84<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>young millionaire wearer of the toga, a senator <i lang="fr">à<!-- TN: original has "a" --> la
mode</i>, listened to Elaine Willoughby’s earnest arguments,
he forgot that he was but forty years of age.</p>

<p>Though he was often an official listener to secrets
in the marble capitol which might make or break the
future of the Sugar Trust, he was also a <i lang="fr">raffiné</i> man
of the modern world—a luxury-lover—fond of money,
and of its concrete power.</p>

<p>He knew, too well, that Elaine Willoughby was
“game” to back her own candidate with a fortune as
great as his own.</p>

<p>He felt that the past safe connection with Hathorn
and Potter was broken for all time. He saw that the
secret chief of the vast Syndicate blindly trusted the
Queen of the Street, and, moreover, he was a man
who was unable to resist the warm, womanly nature
which drew him as the moon draws the seas.</p>

<p>“If you will personally watch over your young
neophyte, Lady Mine,” he said, at last, “I will side
with you. Your interests are mine. I hope that you
do not forget what we both have to lose.” The
Senator was mindful of the sanctity of his “toga,”
now.</p>

<p>With softly shining eyes, she thanked him. “After
all,” she laughed, her bosom heaving with the pride
of victory, “you and I are the only real parties in
interest here. We will let Endicott receive all the
answers, and dear old Hugh Conyers can closely
examine the whole record of the man whom we select
as working partner.</p>

<p>“Between Vreeland and myself, the line of communication
to you shall be guarded. As of old, Judge
Endicott shall act for me—and I will alone handle
all that concerns you. Even Vreeland shall never
<a id="png.087" href="#png.087"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>85<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>know—there’s my hand on it. You know that
Hathorn has always been secretly kept ‘in the dark’<!-- TN: original uses double quotes -->—against
the day of his turning—like the fabled
worm. You are safe as regards him—while <span class="nw">I—”</span></p>

<p>She sighed, and left the man who was the “missing
link” in the great scheme of active operations, wondering
if she had ever really loved Hathorn. The
young Senator was unconsciously grimly jealous.</p>

<p>“Damned little snob!” wrathfully cried the Senator.
“I hope that purse-proud young minx of a wife will
make his life a hell. I fancy that she can be trusted
to do that.” It was Alynton’s just idea of Nemesis.</p>

<p>The Senator had gone back to the Capital next morning
with a parting pledge to make a flying visit to
the “Circassia” in two weeks to settle the vital matter
on Mrs. Willoughby’s winter hegira to New York,
and the active lawyer and the busy journalist had also
fled back to Gotham before Elaine Willoughby in the
summer home had listened to all of Harold Vreeland’s
accurate relation.</p>

<p>“I can not afford to tell her the whole truth—as
yet!” he had rightly decided, and he wisely abstained
from adding a shade of color. For she was watching
him keenly. It was the turning tide of his life.</p>

<p>“You are my own true knight,” she gaily said, with
an assumed lightness. “I wish you to ignore this
coming social battle entirely. You are to be strictly
non-committal. I will deal with both the Hathorns.
Read that.” She handed him a paper. “In this way
we will receive tenders from perhaps fifty individuals,
and even from some good firms already established.</p>

<p>“I will myself, handle the secret side of the operations,
and Judge Endicott will guide you in my
general business. When we have found the right man
<a id="png.088" href="#png.088"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>86<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as a partner, our whole party will examine his past
through the various mercantile agencies, surety companies,
business detectives, and then, Endicott and
Conyers, too, can throw on the searchlight.</p>

<p>“The new firm will go ahead—I can answer for that—and
I will then be free to openly meet Mrs. Alida
Hathorn, on her chosen battle ground of Vanity
Fair.</p>

<p>“You are to do nothing but to simply wait at the
Waldorf—and come to me daily at the ‘Circassia.’</p>

<p>“As for Hathorn—a strict avoidance of him—that is
my one condition.”</p>

<p>“The quarrel—but—the cold oblivion of the grave!
Your friendship is dead to him!”</p>

<p>“And—you are never to mention their names in
society. Leave them to me.”</p>

<p>“I swear it—by this,” solemnly said Vreeland, as he
kissed the knot of ribbon blue. The glistening-eyed
woman saw that it had lain on his heart.</p>

<p>She rose and left him to study the strange public call
for a collaborator in that fierce fight for “the unearned
increment” which was to make his fortune—by
a woman’s fondly trusted faith.</p>

<p>He read an advertisement which made a huge
increase a week later in Hiram Endicott’s daily mail.
For the <cite>Herald</cite>, in special display, in its financial
page, printed the following—in an artful display:</p>

<div class="notice">
<p class="hd">“To Capitalists and Stock Brokers.”</p>

<p>“<i>Wanted.</i>—A gentleman of the highest integrity,
who controls one of the largest speculative stock businesses
in and around New York City, desires to meet
an associate with $200,000 cash, with view of establishing
New York Stock Exchange house, or would
<a id="png.089" href="#png.089"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span

 </span></span></a>make partnership arrangement with a New York
Stock Exchange firm who desire to increase their
business. References given and required. Principals
only. Address, for one week,</p>

<p class="sig">“H. E., <cite>Herald</cite> Downtown.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Elaine Willoughby had been a month entrenched
in her apartments at the “Circassia,” and
the last summer roses had drifted down over the
silent walks of Lakemere, before the astute Vreeland
had made a surface acquaintance with Mr. Horton
Wyman, whose name later headed the sober-looking
black and gold sign on a spacious Broad Street office,
reading, “Wyman &amp; Vreeland, Bankers and Brokers!”
For the new firm had been bravely launched by
Alynton and his lovely ally.</p>

<p>All that Vreeland knew was that Mr. Horton
Wyman was a near relative of Senator David Alynton,
and that he had just given up the cashiership of a
respectable bank to enter the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>The adventurer, lost in admiration of Elaine Willoughby’s
executive ability, never knew of that <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>
dinner, and the long council of the Queen of the
Street with Alynton and Judge Endicott.</p>

<p>Out of fifty applications, Mr. Horton Wyman had
been selected. As Senator Alynton pithily said, “It’s
my man and my money against your man and your
money.” The Senator himself had answered the
call for his relative.</p>

<p>He did know that Judge Endicott’s nephew, Noel,
was the cashier of the new firm, now in full blast, and
that he alone received the orders of the Queen of the
Street from the private wires in the Hanover Bank
Building.</p>

<p><a id="png.090" href="#png.090"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>88<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>And he knew, too, that Mr. Frederick Hathorn’s
office boasted no longer the “inside tip” on Sugar from
the woman who was carrying a social war “into
Africa” and had already staggered even the audacious
Mrs. Alida.</p>

<p>The checks of the new firm on the “Chemical
Bank” were already recognized as those of people
“who could swing the Street,” and some daring
“deals” had opened the game.</p>

<p>It was Vreeland’s duty to confer once daily with his
strangely-found benefactress, and yet, he felt even
now that he was but half within the door.</p>

<p>But one bitter hatred followed his rising star, and he
soon heard the sneer of Frederick Hathorn: “So he
lied to me, and has sneaked into business behind a
woman’s petticoats.</p>

<p>“Wait! Set a beggar on horseback—he will ride to
the devil.” For all that, “they never spoke as they
passed by.” The war was now on in earnest.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 title="V. Toward the zenith"
 ><a id="png.091" href="#png.091"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>89<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="chaphead">TOWARD THE ZENITH.</p>


<p>It had been the one haunting dream of Harold
Vreeland’s fevered young manhood to finally reach a
financial position wherein “the solid ground” would
not fail beneath his feet. Before the Christmas
snows had whitened the roofs of old Trinity his star
was crawling surely toward its zenith. He was,
figuratively speaking, “on velvet.”</p>

<p>Though he realized the cogent truth of Jimmy
Potter’s maxim that the desire of one’s heart would
always finally come around to the patient man, he was
yet filled with a vague uneasiness. He was entrenched
at the Waldorf <i lang="fr">en permanence</i>, and his personal bank
account had reached the snug sum of twenty thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>The status which he held in the firm was that of the
office partner, and he was also authorized to draw one
thousand dollars per month. “If you need anything
else, apply to me directly,” was Mrs. Willoughby’s
quiet order. Anxious not to show even the faintest
eagerness, he was passively contented, allowing his
patroness to make the game. And yet he always
watched her, lynx-eyed.</p>

<p>“My duties,” he had simply demanded.</p>

<p>“You are for the present to confer alone with Mr. Wyman,” answered Elaine. “The books and cash
will be in the sole keeping of young Noel Endicott.
I may say that he alone will sign the firm’s checks
<a id="png.092" href="#png.092"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>90<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and the balance sheets will be privately rendered
by him to Judge Endicott, who represents me, as
well as the power behind your new associate, Mr. Wyman.</p>

<p>“You are to carry on the current business in agreement
with Wyman. Both of you will have access to
all the customers’ ledgers, but the conditions of your
continuance as a broker is that only a strictly
‘commission business’ shall be carried on. And,
above all things, silence and discretion.”</p>

<p>“In other words,” slowly said Vreeland, “Judge
Endicott is really the responsible holder of the firm’s
assets.”</p>

<p>“Precisely so,” smiled Elaine. “His only nephew
is the cashier and the head bookkeeper has been
named by the other principal.”</p>

<p>“Am I to confer as to details with Judge Endicott?”
was Vreeland’s last query.</p>

<p>“Only with me,” she smiled. “You are to be my
own knight, and I lay this last injunction on you:
Business is never to be mentioned to me save in our
daily interview of affairs. My social hours are
sacred.” He bowed and smiled.</p>

<p>“If anything of moment should occur,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“You will be held harmless,” she smiled. “Obey
orders, if you break owners.”</p>

<p>Perfectly conscious that Hathorn would probably
spy upon him, fearful of over-reaching himself by
any rash hurry, Mr. Harold Vreeland assiduously
delved into all the daily business details and carefully
refrained from urging on the growing social intimacy
with his patroness.</p>

<p>Horton Wyman and Noel Endicott were both
<a id="png.093" href="#png.093"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>91<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>University Club men; the last, a stalwart son of Eli,
was a survival of the fittest from the shock of football
and the straining oar.</p>

<p>The cool head bookkeeper, Aubrey Maitland, was
Wyman’s daily luncheon companion, and young Noel
Endicott always fled away at noon hour to the Judge’s
office, where the oak was sported.</p>

<p>It was only in their regularly exchanged uptown
social courtesies that Vreeland was enabled to study
his partner.</p>

<p>It was, after all, of very little moment to him, for
they both seemed to be “personally conducted” by
that silvered-haired old solon, Hiram Endicott. Their
way was made very smooth.</p>

<p>“It’s a very strange situation,” mused Vreeland.
“I am a sort of Ishmael—playing my hand against
every man’s. They all think to find me soon growing
uneasy and squirming around in curiosity.</p>

<p>“‘Time and I against the whole world,’ said William
the Silent. It’s a good motto, and I will let
them make the whole game. But, by and by, I will get
behind the scenes, and then ‘shove the clouds along.’”</p>

<p>With a rare self-control, he continued his judicious
self-effacing policy, and yet slyly watched the impartial
welcome extended by Elaine Willoughby to the
stream of notable and desirable men who thronged
her hospitable halls.</p>

<p>The preliminary skirmishes of the coming battle
with the Hathorns had vastly amused him, and “all
society” knew now of the impassive prudence of the
rising star. It had been Elaine Willoughby’s one fault
that her strong nature leaned little on other women.
For her strong nature buoyed her up above the
petted society dolls around her.</p>

<p><a id="png.094" href="#png.094"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>92<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>She knew that they were barren Sahara deserts to
her; she was perfectly conscious of the absolute dearth
of interest in woman natures for each other. The few
respectable “relicts” who sought her bounty were
always ranged near her, like old battleships on the
shores of Time, honorably scarred, but “out of commission”
and, unfit for action. Their mild incense of
perfunctory flattery was but a prelude to the confession
of their thousand little wants. And to them, she
played the Lady Bountiful.</p>

<p>But Vreeland honestly, yet silently, gloried in
Elaine Willoughby’s brilliant early winter social
campaign.</p>

<p>A lovely Napoleon, she rallied her hosts in a
changed strategy of audacious energy; she chose her
own battle-grounds and vastly outnumbered her
enemy at every point of concentration. It was
a war to the knife.</p>

<p>Through unknown agents, the Lady of Lakemere
had deftly captured the best box in the Horse Show,
and eke the same in the Canine Exposition. She
had ensnared the one most eligible Opera box upon
which Mrs. Alida Hathorn doted, and then, drawing
to her splendid halls the most desirable men to battle
over, Mrs. Willoughby easily attracted a crowd of
bright-eyed beauties there ready to struggle for
their selected “eligibles,” “notables,” and desirables.
There was music and laughter, the gleam of tender
eyes, the sheen of white shoulders, the glow of ivory
bosoms, and all the magnetic thrill of rich young
womanhood pervading the Circassia.</p>

<p>It was no secret that a house party of forty would
keep a “merry Christmas” at Lakemere, and, all in
vain, did Alida Hathorn strive to secure the most
<a id="png.095" href="#png.095"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>93<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>sparkling pendants of the “inner fringe” for the
widely thrown open doors of Oakwood. Her Indian
summer antagonist was an easy victor.</p>

<p>Some merry, audacious devil seemed to have roused
himself in Elaine Willoughby’s bosom, and she was
boldly <i lang="fr">lancée</i> now. Knowing well what a woman’s
war to the finish means, the sly Elaine drew off with
her varied and sumptuous entertainments all the
desirable men and Beauty’s beautiful Cossacks soon
swooped down upon them.</p>

<p>Only Vreeland could trace Senator Alynton’s influence
in the vastly enlarged glittering circle of foreign
diplomats and well accredited European visitors of
rank.</p>

<p>The Army and Navy gallantly charged upon the
battalions of Mother Eve’s fairest forlorn hope, and
humble but effective ammunition—the canvas-back
duck, the terrapin of our beloved land, choicest wines,
chilled and warmed in the right order—did all the
execution possible.</p>

<p>The delicately ordered beaufets were a “continuous
performance” to a star engagement.</p>

<p>And, by a rare self-command, the warring woman
with difficulty refrained from all open attacks upon
the Hathorns, but yet deftly drawing the “financial
swells” to her side by the generally accepted conclusion
that there had been something wrong with
Hathorn &amp; Potter.</p>

<p>No one suspected the genial James of intermeddling.
He had reached no further point in his voyage to
Samarcand, or Swat, than gay Villefranche.</p>

<p>On his cozy yacht, the guileless Potter learned that
Miss Dickie Doubleday, who had returned all of his
“burning letters,” but, none of the sparkling votive
<a id="png.096" href="#png.096"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>94<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>diamonds, had dashingly captured and cut out a
Western mining man of untold millions who guilelessly
had drifted under her guns from a “star” of the
Metropolitan opera. And, the festive Miss Dickie was
now in the seventh heaven.</p>

<p>The gay Eastern Elijah was overjoyed to see his
rosy mantle descend upon the Occidental Elisha, and
he cautiously confided to his deported “Gaiety Girl”
the opinion that the “sun-burned buffalo of Butte
would find out a lot of things before spring.” They
drank the health of the faithless Dickie Doubleday in
much champagne of rosy tint, as the white stars
shimmered around them on the blue waters of the
Mediterranean. And so, the “honors were easy” in
this little game of hearts.</p>

<p>In vain did many friendly financiers urge Jimmy
Potter’s return by the often cabled news that “Hathorn
was making a fool of himself in Wall Street.”</p>

<p>“That’s his own lookout,” calmly replied the
special partner, who rightly feared that the chasm
between him and the all too amiable Dickie Doubleday
was not yet quite deep enough for safety.</p>

<p>“By Jove! that girl is capable of running a tandem,”
he reflected, and, he had no desire to be
hitched up later, even in silken harness, with the
robust “brown buffalo of Butte.” For he had drawn
a “queen” in the last deal.</p>

<p>He would have quickly turned the prow of the
“Aphrodite” homeward, however, if he had known of
a strong-hearted woman’s resolute determination to
run the firm of Hathorn, Wolfe &amp; Co. ashore, and to
sink it under the guns of the unsuspected enemy
which was now “swinging the Street.”</p>

<p>And as artful a game as Delilah ever “put up” for
<a id="png.097" href="#png.097"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>95<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Samson, was one element of Mrs. Willoughby’s campaign,
for she was now “fighting all along the line.”</p>

<p>The watchful Harold Vreeland was soon made
conscious that he was an object of general interest
even in the cold-hearted hurry of Manhattan. He
knew that he penetrated three varying atmospheres in
his daily life.</p>

<p>The society racket, the dress parade of the Waldorf
and the clubs, was one phase of his busy existence; the
shaded dignities of his Broad Street office another, and
he was now assured that an invisible halo of assiduous
espionage now followed him in his down-sittings and
uprisings.</p>

<p>There was the maddened Hathorn, the inscrutable
Elaine Willoughby, and his cautious and silent
partner, Horton Wyman.</p>

<p>“<em>I’m pretty well followed up!</em>” he smiled, with a
cunning glee.</p>

<p>Continually on guard in society, and ever straining
all his mental powers to familiarize himself with all
the details of their growing business and the unwritten
lore of the feverish Street, Vreeland was really only
uneasy at heart as to his continued probation.</p>

<p>For he felt now, as the holiday season approached,
that he was merely being hoodwinked by the dark-eyed
benefactress, whose fullest confidence he had not
as yet gained.</p>

<p>“Madonna’s” social manner was frankly charming,
but he had made no progress toward any further
intimacy. Some shade seemed to hold them tenderly
apart. And he racked his brains in vain.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Ami intime de la maison!</i>” He had only learned
more of her rare dignity in the repeated business
interviews, and in the continued tableaux of her
<a id="png.098" href="#png.098"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>96<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>splendid social <i lang="fr">entourage</i>, he was no nearer to her
than others.</p>

<p>There was the cool Conyers, who always came and
went at will; he had also seen Senator David Alynton
and the silent Wyman out driving with his lovely
patroness. There were also <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> dinners, too,
with the old Judge and that young son of Anak, Noel
Endicott, and moreover the well-bribed Justine
spoke, too, of breakfasts where only Wyman and the
handsome bookkeeper, Aubrey Maitland, were guests.
<em>All</em> this was dangerous.</p>

<p>“Hang me if I can see why I am kept here,”
uneasily fretted Vreeland. “The firm would move
along just as smoothly without me,” but yet in his
soul he felt that the steadfast woman still held him in
reserve for some well-matured purpose of her own.</p>

<p>With admirable <i lang="fr">sang froid</i> he awaited her orders
in an expectant silence.</p>

<p>“She shall not weary me out; but once let the
cards come my way, then I will play the queen for all
she is worth.”</p>

<p>He knew in the drift of customers gradually drawn
in by the now acknowledged solidity of their firm,
that there were many spies and stool-pigeons of the
angry Hathorns.</p>

<p>He knew, too, what cold resentment burned in his
old chum’s heart. He had secretly followed (through
his agents) some of these skirmishers directly back to
Hathorn, Wolfe &amp; Co.’s office. And the cards were
played both from the top and the bottom of the pack.</p>

<p>Once he had himself caught Hathorn’s eyes following
him with all the wolfish glare of a murderous
heart.</p>

<p>There were, besides, rumors of quarrels in the
<a id="png.099" href="#png.099"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>97<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>opposing firm and the early retirement of the returning
Potter.</p>

<p>And other sly traps were laid for him with silky
scoundrelism. He was well aware that the defiant
Alida Hathorn had openly expressed her utter disbelief
in the existence of the late Wharton Willoughby.
Even the prehensile Mrs. Volney McMorris had
waylaid him to confess that she had never observed,
in either of Mrs. Willoughby’s establishments, any
mortuary bust, portrait, or even an humble photograph
of the permanently eclipsed man who had
given his name to the Queen of the Street. These
things were food for uneasy thoughts harassing to
the young schemer.</p>

<p>And this respectable social scavenger had faltered
out some indirect javelin thrusts evidently pointed
by Hathorn’s willfully reckless wife.</p>

<p>There were at least two men in Elaine Willoughby’s
<i lang="fr">entourage</i> who, for gain and a passion under the
rose, might be the source of all that quietly-sustained
splendor which had so enraged the young married
heiress.</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Vreeland was on guard. He only fixed
his fine eyes upon Mrs. McMorris in a pained surprise
when that bustling dame hinted that he could easily
drag forth the desired information.</p>

<p>“I have always had a penchant, my dear Madame,
for minding my own business,” was his most prudent
rejoinder.</p>

<p>So, entrenching himself in the towers of silence,
he was safe, but Vreeland also left a bitter enemy
behind, on the pleasant afternoon when he wondered
why Messrs. Merriman, Wiltshire, and Rutherstone
had bidden him “to be one of a little party of four”
<a id="png.100" href="#png.100"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>98<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>at the Old York Club. It was an able effort at scientific
pumping.</p>

<p>He had never entered that gilded fortress of the
<i lang="fr">jeunesse dorée<!-- TN: original reads "doree" --></i> since his last definite quarrel with Hathorn,
and he knew, too, that these three “splendid
examples of the evolution of American manhood”
now made up a little coterie which was a sort of
Three Guardsmen brotherhood around Mrs. Alida
Hathorn.</p>

<p>There were rumors of gay little Sunday afternoon
frolics at the Hathorns’, justifying Pip’s exclamation,
“Such larks,” and these three young fellows now
directed the broad-gauge festivities of a home whose
master always wore a stern frown like the late
lamented “Baron Rudiger” of the German song.</p>

<p>It was Harold Vreeland’s chosen part to be
left judiciously uncompromised. He was still playing a
waiting game. He knew that certain very <i lang="fr">dégagée<!-- TN: original reads "degagée" --></i>
young “married women” afforded much “congenial
pabulum” for these three sleek young society sharks,
and that the careless Mrs. Alida Hathorn was fast
drifting into their hands.</p>

<p>And so, after a long <i lang="fr">séance</i>, wherein floods of wine
drenched the festal board, the sly adventurer found
out at last the motive of his sudden popularity.</p>

<p>When Rutherstone brought up the unlaid ghost of
the late Wharton Willoughby, Vreeland cynically
remarked: “I naturally know nothing of local social
biography here. I am only a returned borderer, and
am only engaged in making a proper business
use of my capital. I stand calmly in the center of
your New York circus and see its ‘free show’ swing
around.</p>

<p>“My platform is that of the late Simon Cameron of
<a id="png.101" href="#png.101"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>99<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>blessed memory, ‘I don’t care a damn what happens
as long as it does not happen to me.’”</p>

<p>“But, the lady has intimate business relations with
your firm!” babbled Merriman.</p>

<p>“Did Fred Hathorn tell you so?” cuttingly sneered
Vreeland. “Perhaps not, as you fellows are only
chummy with his smart wife. Let her find it out
for herself, by a personal visit to the lady in question.</p>

<p>“You might ask Wyman—he knows all our thousand
customers’ affairs. I don’t bother much with the
business,” loftily remarked Vreeland, as he hummed
an old music hall refrain, “You can get onto an omnibus,
but you can’t get onto me.”</p>

<p>He cheerfully departed, leaving his hosts to “a
night of memories and sighs.” He was followed
with curses both deep and loud.</p>

<p>Vreeland put all these little matters lightly away
as a part of the usual “burrowing mole” work of New
York high life; but he was really astonished, a
week later, when his employer’s physician, Dr. Hugo
Alberg, haled him away to a confidential Sunday
morning breakfast.</p>

<p>The “German specialist” was an indurated foreign
egotist of thirty, and a cunning gleam lingered
behind his golden glasses.</p>

<p>His fresh, bewhiskered face was slightly Semitic in
its cast, and his record of prosperity was all too evident
in that richness of jewelry which has been a
legacy of the Biblical times when the Egyptians
made such incautious loans of their ornaments.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland had now an unwritten chapter in
his life devoted entirely to the thirsty-hearted Justine,
and from that subjugated Gallic beauty he knew of
all Alberg’s crafty approaches upon the mistress by a
<a id="png.102" href="#png.102"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>100<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>coarsely familiar wooing of the woman who had given
herself over, body and soul, to Vreeland’s service.</p>

<p>And so he marveled not that in the cozy private
room at Martin’s the Doctor’s slim, white, “sterilized”
hand reached out in the direction of a secret which
Vreeland himself knew naught of.</p>

<p>“I’ll just let this fool talk,” mused Vreeland, as
the intriguing foreigner became both familiar and
friendly. “He has his own little scheme. Perhaps
he may point me toward what no one seems to know.”</p>

<p>And so, in an affected <i lang="de">bruderschaft</i>, the would-be
vampire listened with a beating heart to Alberg’s
confidences when the strong Rhine wine had loosened
the “Medical Arzt’s” slightly thickened tongue.</p>

<p>“We ought to understand each other, <i lang="de">mein lieber</i><!-- TN: original reads "leiber" -->
Vreeland,” urged the Doctor, who had now thrown
the mask off. “You and I are the two men nearest
to this magnificent woman. You are her confidential
man of affairs.</p>

<p>“You know all—you <em>must</em> know all. And a woman’s
best friend is always her Doctor,” he grinned, with a
suggestive pliancy.</p>

<p>“We are necessary to each other. You and I only
want what all New York wants—<em>money</em>!</p>

<p>“Money talks in New York. Life is a hell without
money. Now, my dear friend, we are both making
money out of her <em>easily</em>. And to me, as well as to
you, Mrs. Willoughby’s life is of great importance.</p>

<p>“For my fee bill and your profits depend upon her
being kept alive.”</p>

<p>Vreeland started, in a sudden alarm. “Speak out,
man! What the devil do you mean?” He saw a
black gulf yawning before him.</p>

<p>“She has some concealed source of mental trouble,
<a id="png.103" href="#png.103"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>101<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>some eating sorrow, some overmastering secret of
her old life,” bluntly answered Alberg. “You, as a
man of the world, could easily guess that such a
woman should be married. She is rich, still very
beautiful, young enough yet—she hardly looks thirty-three—woman’s
royal epoch of mental force and
bodily attractiveness. Now, she has strange periods
of a profound mental depression.</p>

<p>“There are dark storms of sorrow. Her heart
action is somewhat impaired, and the waves of passion
beat too fiercely in her locked breast.</p>

<p>“<em>You must help me!</em> You may, in this way, save
your own future. We must work together. Drugs
will do her no good. <em>I am at my wits’ ends!</em>” The
gloomy Doctor buried his nose again in the Rudesheimer.</p>

<p>“What can I do?” flatly said Vreeland. “Speak
out! Don’t mince matters.”</p>

<p>“Find out her past social history. Find out if she
ever was really married. Find out if some one has
a hold on her. <em>She is an unhappy woman at heart!</em>”
cried Alberg. “It may be that damned cold-hearted
cur, Hathorn’s, desertion has cut her to the quick!
Find out if she really is a <em>free woman</em>!”</p>

<p>“And, then?” said Vreeland, a strange light coming
into his eyes.</p>

<p>“<em>Marry her yourself</em>,” pleaded Alberg. “<em>She is one
woman in a million!</em> Take her away for a year.
Lead her away from her old self. Pride brought low
may have maddened her. I think that Hathorn first
fathomed her past, and then, coldly left her for the
younger and perhaps richer woman. It may have
been too heavy a blow to her pride.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything in this babble about Endicott
<a id="png.104" href="#png.104"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>102<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>or the Senator?” huskily whispered Vreeland, reddening
with shame in spite of himself.</p>

<p>The half-tipsy Doctor laughed. “The old man is
only her business Mentor—he is as passionless as a
basalt block.</p>

<p>“The Senator is but a cold-hearted money schemer,
a Yankee coining power into hard cash. I’ve followed
all these trails out.”</p>

<p>“And you yourself are absolutely in the dark?”
persisted Vreeland. “I’ve thought at times that old
Endicott may be the trustee under some quiet old
marital separation. I’ve imagined, too, that Willoughby
<i lang="fr">mari</i> may not be really dead; that she, in spite
of herself, learned to passionately love Hathorn, and
has ardently desired him, and that he selfishly married
after she had pulled him up to fortune, and then, left
her powerless and tongue-tied, to pocket his brutal
ingratitude.</p>

<p>“Whatever it is, we need each other, Vreeland.
I will stand by you if you stand by me. Is it a
bargain?”</p>

<p>“I’ll see you here the same time next Sunday.
Let me think this thing over,” faltered Vreeland,
beginning to see light at last on his way.</p>

<p>“I should have told you that she usually has these
attacks after Endicott’s occasional long private visits.
It may be that the missing husband is <em>alive</em>, and is
bleeding her financially with extortionate demands,”
was the Doctor’s last confidence.</p>

<p>“I’ll be ready to talk to you next Sunday. Let me
go now,” breathlessly cried Vreeland. “In the
meantime, keep a close silence. You will find me to
be the best friend you ever had in the world.”</p>

<p>The schemer darted away with a sudden impulse.</p>

<p><a id="png.105" href="#png.105"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>103<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Ten minutes later he sat with Justine Duprez, in a
hidden little nest of her own in South Fifth Avenue.
It had flashed over his mind that Mlle. Justine’s
Sunday off, just suited his purpose.</p>

<p>It was not the first time that he had communed
with her there, in a room once sacred to Frederick
Hathorn’s private information bureau.</p>

<p>The startled maid had barely time to meet her
generous new admirer when he questioned her
sharply upon the subject of Doctor Alberg’s recent
revelations.</p>

<p>And, to his annoyance, he for the first time found the
Parisian woman to be obdurate. She had been
curtly abandoned by Hathorn, who had forgotten to
hand over her final payment in all the hurried glories
of the VanSittart wedding.</p>

<p>She alone knew that the vain fool had stupidly
imagined that Elaine Willoughby only urged on his
marriage in order to be able later to cloak an intimacy
which would have later made Justine’s fortune.</p>

<p>And now, she would not be balked out of the
harvest of fortune. For an hour, the ardent Vreeland
pleaded with the artful woman. Her bold eyes,
dulled with the bistre stains, gleamed with triumph as
he pleaded with her.</p>

<p>The elegant young man alternately flattered and
caressed the brown-faced <i lang="fr">intrigante</i>, whose coarse
beauty had long been the toast of the <i lang="fr">cabaret</i> which
she yearned to possess in Paris.</p>

<p>Her voluptuous bosom and heavy haunches were
the antipodes of Vreeland’s beauty ideal, and yet, he
knelt to flatter and to sue. For she alone could spy
upon the most sacred privacy of the woman he had
sworn to rule.</p>

<p><a id="png.106" href="#png.106"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>104<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Justine eyed him keenly, and spoke at last. “Give
me a thousand dollars and promise that you will give
me a free hand if you marry Madame,” she said, as she
yielded to his self-abusing pleadings.</p>

<p>“And only you shall know her secrets. I hate
that Doctor!” she cried. “I can find out all you
want to know, but, you must do as I wish.” Her
velvet eyes gleamed in a fierce flame.</p>

<p>“Listen, Justine,” urged Vreeland. “To-morrow
I will bring you a thousand dollars when I come to
the Circassia. Tell me now what you can; I swear
to make you rich if you will only stand by me. It is
Sunday,” he added. “No banks are open to-day.
This first hundred will not count.”</p>

<p>And he thrust a bill into her brown hand.</p>

<p>“I have watched for years to find the secret of her
past life,” promptly said the sly Justine, drawing nearer
to Vreeland. “I, too, thought of an <i lang="fr">affaire</i>. It is not.
But, <em>a secret there is</em>, and only one man knows—the
old lawyer. I hid myself near them on his last
visit, for they talked long, and Madame fell down fainting
after he had gone away.</p>

<p>“Their talk was of the old times, and it is always so,
when they come to that. But, <em>this time</em> I listened
carefully while she moaned in her sorrow.”</p>

<p>“And she said?” anxiously cried Vreeland.</p>

<p>“‘<em>My child! My child! Give me back my child!</em>’
she cried. And so there is a child, and <em>it is not of the
Senator!</em> <i lang="fr">Voilà<!-- TN: original reads "Voila" -->!</i> They are <i lang="fr">stupidement placide
toujours! Les affaires!</i> Only—<i>ze monnaie</i>! She
loves him not. And only the old man knows. You
shall watch him and her.”</p>

<p>A sudden suspicion of a feminine double life
brought a name to Vreeland’s lips.</p>

<p><a id="png.107" href="#png.107"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>105<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Hathorn!” he said, with a meaning look at his
partner in an already vicious intrigue. For Justine
Duprez knew him in all the pliant baseness of his
real nature, and they had groveled toward each other
from the very first.</p>

<p>The Parisian gamine laughed a bitter, hard laugh.</p>

<p>“I have been at Madame’s side since the first day
when this egoist Hathorn first met her. There
has been no love, no intrigue, no child. And he—the
hard-hearted brute—schemed only for her money.</p>

<p>“No! It is beyond me. Beyond my seven years
of service. I will reach <i lang="fr">la mystère</i> yet for you,” she
smiled. “And you will perhaps find that there was
ze old divorce, ze old-time <i lang="fr">scandale</i>. And the
other man, the husband, has perhaps taken away
the child. The sorrow, <em>yes</em>; the secret <i lang="fr">d’amour, no!
Elle est trop bravement bête pour l’amour à<!-- TN: original reads "a" --> la mode.</i></p>

<p>“<!-- TN: opening quote invisible -->The journalist? Ah, no! <i lang="fr">Il n’est qu’un brave ami!
Pas plus!</i>” It was dark before the “rising star” dared
to steal away from Justine’s little <i lang="fr">pied à terre</i>, for too
well Vreeland knew that the enraged Hathorn was
shadowing his every movement.</p>

<p>Justine had fled away, light-hearted, after the
sealing of a pact which was to lead her to the splendors
of <i lang="fr">Dame du Comptoir</i> of her own <i lang="fr">cabaret</i>. And
as Vreeland strolled homeward he summed up the
situation.</p>

<p>“Her only friend and confidant is Endicott. No
thoroughfare there. Alberg, this German brute,
knows nothing and Hathorn less than nothing, or
he would have already used it against her in this
bitter petticoat fight.</p>

<p>“I will hoodwink them all. My time will come when
I have gained her cherished secret. And if I do gain
<a id="png.108" href="#png.108"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>106<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>her secret, it will be on the market, to the highest bidder,
perhaps to the dashing Alida Hathorn, or else be
quietly nursed to later bring me in a fortune.”
He was satisfied with his day’s work. The light
was dawning now.</p>

<p>When the adventurer reviewed the whole situation,
he felt that the mystery was as yet hidden in
Elaine Willoughby’s ardent bosom. “The day will
come when she will need me, when she will tell
me all, when she is safe to live a free woman’s
heart-life. I will wait on her and give no one my confidence.”</p>

<p>During the long, busy week before the Christmas
holidays, Vreeland narrowly watched his strange,
silent partner, Horton Wyman, to see if he were
bidden to the Lakemere house party.</p>

<p>“He is the only one that I have to fear,” mused
Vreeland, “for, with Senator Alynton’s backing and
his daily intercourse with old Endicott, I would be
bowled out in a moment, if I made a single misstep.
Can he yearn for Elaine Willoughby’s money?”</p>

<p>In the daily office associations, the casual meetings
at the Circassia, in the feebly maintained exchange
of personal hospitalities, Horton Wyman had so far
remained to him an unexplored country.</p>

<p>Cool, sturdy, with piercing black eyes, and a marvelous
self-control, with a facial mask which even a
Jesuit might have envied, Horton Wyman was
seemingly devoid of any passion but money-making.</p>

<p>Vreeland had gained the general impression that
he was “bookish,” and the silent partner avoided
all show society.</p>

<p>Thirty-five years sat lightly on the man, whose
scanty references to Senator Alynton’s millionaire
<a id="png.109" href="#png.109"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>107<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>father indicated that the “poor relation,” had been
trained up in adversity as the dead financier’s private
secretary. “He is a fellow to beware of. I’ll let
him alone,” mused Vreeland.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland thanked his lucky stars when
Wyman drew him into his private den when the first
sporadic Christmas trees were beginning to creep into
Gotham.</p>

<p>“Well, old man,” cheerfully said Wyman, “I’m off
for a two weeks’ visit to the Alyntons. Endicott will
handle our Board work through his uncle’s private
broker, and Maitland and Noel will take their leave
after we return. I suppose that you will be at the
Lakemere house party.</p>

<p>“Of course, there’s no need of you following up
things at the office. Here’s my telegraph address, if
anything turns up, and, of course, Mrs. Willoughby
will call on you if she needs anything.</p>

<p>“We’ve got the thing running pretty smoothly, so
take your full share of mistletoe. Noel tells me that
all the prettiest girls in town will be up there at
Lakemere.” It was a welcome relief.</p>

<p>“I have now a free field,” jubilantly exclaimed
Vreeland. “He is as indifferent to her as if she
were only a cloak model. <em>Now, for Lakemere!</em>”</p>

<p>Vreeland never stopped in his trickery to be
ashamed of his low truckling with the French maid,
whose malleable conscience was at his disposal, in the
hopes of much future backsheesh.</p>

<p>And so the adroit Continental Doctor had now two
false friends between him and the woman who was his
“star patient” and whom he, too, intended for an
innocent dupe. The fate of every rich and lonely
woman!</p>

<p><a id="png.110" href="#png.110"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>108<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>It was under the Christmas tree at Lakemere that
Harold Vreeland learned for the first time why the
Queen of the Street had held him for months in a
glittering quiescence in the rapidly built-up firm.</p>

<p>The merry guests were already assembled on the
other side of the curtain when the breathless Justine
drew Vreeland into a dark corner.</p>

<p>The French woman’s panting bosom heaved as she
whispered: “She wants to see you in there, first of
all. Now is your time, but don’t forget me, Harold.”</p>

<p>There was the pledge of an infamous pact in the
meeting of their guilty eyes. Justine now stood, with
flaming sword, between her secret lover and those
who would approach the woman who held both their
fortunes. Her dark fidelity was doubly bought.</p>

<p>It was a robed queen who stood waiting there by the
fragrant Christmas tree and held both her hands out
to Harold Vreeland. The Lady of Lakemere at her
very best!</p>

<p>With beaming eyes, she handed him an envelope
and whispered: “The time has now come when you
will have your own part to play, under my sole orders.</p>

<p>“I know your whole record. You have been my
own faithful knight.</p>

<p>“Listen! All these merrymakers will go away with
the old year. Judge Endicott brings me the firm’s
settlement papers on New Years. I will then send
for you and make you my secret representative in a
momentous affair.</p>

<p>“To protect my interests you must at once leave
the Waldorf.</p>

<p>“Trust to me!” she smiled. “I will have your
bachelor apartments ready. And no one, not even
Wyman, must ever learn of your ‘secret service.’
<a id="png.111" href="#png.111"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>109<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Silence and obedience, and your fortune is assured.
You alone shall battle for me and drive this fool
Hathorn forever from the Street.</p>

<p>“Go now! You will leave with the first departing
guests, but await my telegram at the Waldorf to
come to me here. And so, I have your plighted word.
Never a whisper to a living soul. You are to be
still only the office partner—<em>to the world</em>!”</p>

<p>Vreeland snatched her trembling hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>It was burning in fever.</p>

<p>But he sped away, and before the curtain rose to a
chorus of happy laughter and shouts of delighted
surprise, a glance in a corner of the hallway where
Justine awaited him showed him a check for twenty-five
thousand dollars as his Christmas gift. His
patroness had handed him the precious envelope in
silence.</p>

<p>In a low whisper he opened the gates of paradise to
the French woman, who watched her lover with
flaming eyes. “Five thousand dollars of this to you,
if you find out for me the secret of that child.”</p>

<p>And he left her, panting with the thrill of a sated
avarice.</p>

<p>“I will go through fire and water to serve you,” she
faltered. “I will steal the secret from her midnight
dreams.”</p>

<p>That night, after the gay dances were done, when
the house was stilled, Elaine Willoughby sat before
her fire, while Justine laid away the regal robes.</p>

<p>There was the glitter of diamonds and the shimmer
of pearls everywhere. With her hands clasped, the
lonely mistress of Lakemere gazed into the dancing
flames.</p>

<p>“I must crush him—to leave the past buried—that
<a id="png.112" href="#png.112"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>110<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I may yet find the path trodden by those little wandering
feet.</p>

<p>“Ah, my God!” she moaned, “it is not revenge that
I want. It is love—<em>her love</em>—I burn to know her mine
alone. And the past shall be kept as a sealed book,
for her dear sake. It must be so. It is the only
way. For, Vreeland is brave and true!”</p>

<p>The handsome hypocrite was even then dreaming
of a “double event,” a duplicated prize, one beyond
his wildest hopes.</p>

<p>“By heaven! I’ll have both her and the fortune!”
His busy, familiar devil “laughed by his side.”</p>

<hr class="tiny">



<h3 title="VI. In the “Elmleaf” bachelor apartments"
 >CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class="chaphead">IN THE “ELMLEAF” BACHELOR APARTMENTS.</p>


<p>Mr. Harold Vreeland silently wondered at the
protean character of womanhood as he watched Mrs. Elaine Willoughby’s almost feverish gaiety in the
few days which followed their new relation. “I can
believe anything of a woman’s subtle arts after this,”
he wonderingly said, as he made himself a graceful
factor in the joys under holly and mistletoe.</p>

<p>Not a single reference to the coming business had
ever escaped her, and she was as merrily impartial
in her favors as a girl at her first ball.</p>

<p>There was hardly a financier in the house party,
Noel Endicott’s visit of a day being a mere duty call.
“She evidently wishes to hide our intimacy from all,
and to publicly impress only the social character
on our friendship,” mused Vreeland.</p>

<p>“Lady mine! you are a deep one!” he mused.
Never had he been placed next to her at dinner, and
even at the cotillion’s trifling favors she had only
sought him among the very last.</p>

<p>He was aware that all New York knew of how Hathorn
had been coached up by her into financial glory.
“That mistake she will not repeat. It’s a case
of blood and the secret warpath, now,” reflected
Vreeland.</p>

<p><a id="png.114" href="#png.114"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>112<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>But with the check for twenty-five thousand dollars
in his pocket, he felt that his silence was paid for in
advance. He was swimming gaily on with the current
now.</p>

<p>He had calmed Dr. Hugo Alberg down into an expectant
friendship by agreeing to dine with him once a
week and to exchange regular reports at Martin’s.</p>

<p>“So far, I have found out nothing, Doctor,” said
the lying Vreeland; “but I have written out West.
I understand that she has immense properties in
Colorado. If I get a clew, you and I will work it up
together.</p>

<p>“In the meantime watch over her yourself, and then
tell me all.”</p>

<p>Alberg was in high glee at his social début, and
confided to Vreeland that their patroness was in the
most brilliant health.</p>

<p>“<em>Well</em>,” good-humoredly answered Vreeland,
“between you and me we will manage to guard her
and take care of her property, if she will only let us.”</p>

<p>The miserly German’s eyes gleamed as they drank
to their private pact.</p>

<p>“The great thing is to keep every one else away
from her,” whispered Alberg. “I of course watch
her professionally. You must keep off all those
society sharks like that upstart Hathorn.”</p>

<p>“Trust to me. I know my business,” laughed
Vreeland.</p>

<p>When Vreeland left Lakemere on the last day of the
old year, his only reminder was the whispered word,
“Remember!”</p>

<p>“I will wait at the Waldorf,” he answered, with a
last meaning gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p>Standing now on an almost secure pedestal,
<a id="png.115" href="#png.115"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>113<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Vreeland never dared to dream of the sentimental approach
upon the woman who was now the sole arbiter of his
destiny.</p>

<p>“That would be the clumsiest mistake of all,” he
decided. “Only—when she comes into the net—I
will tighten it.”</p>

<p>He well knew that the bachelor apartment was to
be the scene of some veiled financial strategy and not
a rosy Paphian bower.</p>

<p>Mean and low at heart as he was, he knew that
her soul towered above all low deceit, as the rosy
Jungfrau lifts its unsullied peaks to the blue skies.</p>

<p>The one rare virtue of this scoundrel in embryo was
that no inane self-conceit clouded his clear and
mercilessly direct reasoning.</p>

<p>“I am only her tool as yet,” he reflected.</p>

<p>“But the Endicotts, Aubrey Maitland, and Wyman
are to know nothing! This, of course, excludes
Senator Alynton. She trusts me then <em>alone</em>—of the
whole world.” And so, he panted for the coming
solution of the enigma.</p>

<p>As he departed for New York, he left one lynx-eyed
aid behind him.</p>

<p>It was the hot-hearted Justine, who already knew
what her <i lang="fr">étrennes</i> would be—a second thousand dollars.</p>

<p>“Remember, my own Justine,” he urged, with
glowing eyes, “I want you to earn that whole five
thousand dollars. Spy on Alberg.</p>

<p>“He is only a fool. But catch every whisper of this
wary old Endicott. He alone knows what you must
learn. There lies your fortune—in those pretty ears.”</p>

<p>“I have made my plan,” smilingly whispered the
brown-skinned maid. “I am going to earn that
money. Remember, I am <i lang="fr">vraie Française</i>!”</p>

<p><a id="png.116" href="#png.116"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>114<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>There were but two plausible explanations of
Madonna’s strangely secret course. Some “deed
without a name” was in the plot.</p>

<p>And none of her old friends, no one of the financial
world, not even her advisers, tried and true, were to
share the secret of the two for whom the “bachelor
apartment” was to be the veiled headquarters.</p>

<p>“Either Hathorn has surprised the secret of her early
life and spirited away her child, hoping to have drawn
her down to his will, or—can it be that she means to
sell out the sugar syndicate?”</p>

<p>He gazed reflectively at the winter landscape flying
by, as he pondered over the first. “<em>No!</em>” was his
correct deduction. “Hathorn is powerless. He would
surely have held on to her business, by fear or force,
and gained the inside track in the great gamble, Sugar.</p>

<p>“He would have bent her to his will, and carried on
the old hideous gilded sin—to make his light o’ love
his young wife’s best friend.</p>

<p>“That’s quite <i lang="fr">fin de siècle</i> in New York, they
tell me.</p>

<p>“His crime was only the bull-headed folly of
preferring another and a younger woman to the one
woman whom he could have gratefully and logically
married.</p>

<p>“There is a man’s fatuous vanity to look for her
support in chasing down a younger and prettier rival
under her very eyes. And yet, she hastened on the
marriage. By Jove! she did. It’s a mystery to me!”</p>

<p>The puzzled schemer never knew of the real foundation
of his own blossoming fortunes.</p>

<p>The lightning flashes of Elaine Willoughby’s mad
anger came when Judge Endicott had found out that
Frederick Hathorn was secretly shadowing his loving
<a id="png.117" href="#png.117"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>115<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and trusting employer and tracing back her past life.
Then, Elaine Willoughby became a wolf on the trail.</p>

<p>All of social life is but a hoodman blind game. The
stern old lawyer was only carrying out a secret quest,
and he could not divine that Hathorn’s real object
was to trace down to a direct connection Elaine
Willoughby’s secret alliance with the heads of the
great Sugar Trust. It was but a mean money greed,
after all.</p>

<p>Keenly alive to every pointer of the Street, Hathorn
had not learned, for all his five years of florid
devotion, that his lovely patroness had sealed that
one treasured secret in her soul. And, meanly, he had
tried to dig under her mines. But it was the thirst
for gold alone that fired his veins.</p>

<p>Hiram Endicott alone knew of the coolly-devised
scheme by which the woman whom he had deceived
had made Hathorn’s marriage and enforced absence
the epoch for a complete break-off of all business
relations.</p>

<p>But she, deluded, as even the keenest mortals are,
in stocks, love, or war, only feared for the one darling
secret of her heart—that veiled sorrow which lay
behind Hiram Endicott’s useless search of years.</p>

<p>And in the defense of that one pure and unsullied
memory, she would have torn herself from Hathorn’s
arms even at the altar. For there is a love which
can tear the face of any man from a true woman’s
heart—the mother love.</p>

<p>Before Harold Vreeland reached New York he had
decided upon the “Sugar speculations” as the secret
reason for setting up the “bachelor apartment.”</p>

<p>It was now a matter of gossip on the Street that the
great Standard Oil Company was reaching its octopus
<a id="png.118" href="#png.118"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>116<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>arms out for “safe investments,” as well as sure
new speculative fields.</p>

<p>To use a huge surplus of idle money and an inexhaustible
credit, it was rumored that they proposed
to sneak into a quiet mastery of the American
Sugar Refinery Company’s outside stock, and even in
time to gather in all the great Gas monopolies of
Manhattan Island.</p>

<p>“<em>That’s my lady’s game!</em>” gleefully cried Vreeland.
“She could crush Hathorn at will. Their business
is ruined. The ugly rumors as to his shabby behavior
to her have hurt that firm.</p>

<p>“And Potter, too, is about to draw out. Wolfe has no
money to speak of. ‘Missie VanSittart’ will not pay
her husband’s stock losses, not she.”</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland grinned, for the young woman’s
name was even now lightly bandied by the club jackals,
but only <i lang="it">sotto voce</i>, in deference to her social rank.</p>

<p>“That’s her little game! She dares not let Alynton
know that she proposes to dally with the other side in
this coming fight of giants.</p>

<p>“She proposes to ‘copper’ the game of ‘more sweetness
and light,’ as well as play it for a sure winner.</p>

<p>“And I am to be her <em>left hand</em>, and the <em>right</em> (our
firm) is to be ignorant of what the left doeth!”</p>

<p>He was well aware that in some way she was always
early possessed of all the Sugar Syndicate secrets.
Whether Endicott, Alynton, the statesman, or Conyers
was her coach, he knew not.</p>

<p>“Perhaps all three—the law, the senate, and journalism,”
he grinned.</p>

<p>“<em>Or, is she going to betray these people to the
newcomers?</em> There would be enormous profits in that
‘sweet surrender.’</p>

<p><a id="png.119" href="#png.119"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>117<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I shall enjoy the run, and be in at the death,” he
gaily cried, as he sought his hotel in a vastly enhanced
good humor.</p>

<p>When he entered the Waldorf, a sudden encounter
made him think that angels of light had invaded the
crepuscular gloom of the long hall in the early winter
evening.</p>

<p>He scarcely credited his senses when Mrs. Frederick
Hathorn motioned him to a corner of the Turkish
room, after his startled but gravely polite salute.</p>

<p>The lady was a ravishing example of the “survival
of the fittest” in the line of Worth, Pingât, and
Redfern.</p>

<p>With a wave of her slender hand she swept away the
flood of easy lies that were trembling on his lips, and
then, her bright eyes, deep and searching, seemed to
delve into his very soul.</p>

<p>“Remember, you need not answer, if you don’t
care to; but you must give me the right to feel that
you are a gentleman. My husband’s enemies <em>may</em>
or <em>may not</em> be mine!” She burned a Parthian glance
into his trembling heart.</p>

<p>“Why did you conceal from him that you were going
into banking, and let him go on and parade you as his
best friend, and all that?” she curtly demanded.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hathorn,” earnestly pleaded the accomplished
liar, “another man had my promise of partnership
long before I left Montana. He was already
making arrangements as to offices and several confidential
matters on which our firm’s future depended.</p>

<p>“I was only asked to give your husband an answer
on October 1st.</p>

<p>“And I did give one early enough—a friendly
declination—which your husband made me repeat too
<a id="png.120" href="#png.120"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>118<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>forcibly. You should not blame me for our little
estrangement.”</p>

<p>“And you did not scheme to supplant him with—<span class="nw">with—”</span></p>

<p>“One word, Madame,” meaningly said Vreeland.
“I have opened my heart to you. <i lang="fr">Noblesse oblige!</i>
Your question was one I could honorably answer,
just as I could <em>not</em> honorably forewarn men whom fate
had made our business rivals.</p>

<p>“Remember, all’s fair in love, stocks, and war.
And it’s every man for himself in New York.”</p>

<p>“And every woman, too,” added Mrs. Alida, with
a little snaky smile.</p>

<p>“I always liked you,” she hesitatingly said, and then,
her eyes dropped before the ardent and merciless
gaze of a man who now saw “a new way to pay old
debts.”</p>

<p>“Then let me volunteer a hint that I have never
supplanted your husband with anyone nor sought to.
My capital alone gives me weight in our firm. I have
never even opened a ledger or made an individual transaction.</p>

<p>“Pride and old comradeship should temper each
other in your husband. I have only avoided the
distressing embarrassments which he alone has
brought upon himself, and you will always find me
your secret friend, though I can not seek you out in
this witches’ parade of Gotham. You know all the
reasons why I can not range myself openly at your
side.” His devilish familiar was now whispering in
his ear.</p>

<p>The victim was young, fair, and foolish.</p>

<p>The luxurious woman sighed. All her allures had
been baffled.</p>

<p><a id="png.121" href="#png.121"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>119<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“<em>If I should need to tax your friendship?</em>” she
slowly said, her breathing quick and fierce, telling
of her agitation.</p>

<p>It was now Vreeland’s eyes which “burned into her
spirit’s core.”</p>

<p>“Yes; if you make the place where we can meet
without a foolish risk and placing us both in a false
position.”</p>

<p>He glanced around the debatable ground of the
Turkish room. Any notable, from Chauncey
Depew down to the last “Western bonanza beauty,”
might surprise them there at any moment.</p>

<p>“Will you come, if you need me?” he whispered,
taking her hand, with insidious suggestion.</p>

<p>“<em>Perhaps</em>,” she faltered, with pale and trembling
lips, and when he looked up he was alone, but a knot
of lilies of the valley from her corsage lay in his
hand.</p>

<p>He dreamed strange dreams that night, for he well
knew of the seraglio secrets of the bachelor apartments
of New York.</p>

<p>He knew the light vanity that might lead her
feet to the “Castle Dangerous” to solve the riddle
which was as yet a mystery to himself.</p>

<p>But he whistled “Donna è Mobile” very contentedly,
as he awoke to find a telegram on New
Year’s morning from his sly partner in an already
plotted treason. Justine’s words were pithy, and
Justine was on guard.</p>

<p>“<em>Watch in South Fifth Avenue for news!</em>”</p>

<p>The simple signature J followed the words: “<i>Lawyer
here. See me first on your arrival.</i>”</p>

<p>“I think that I am a pretty lucky devil,” was the
flattering unction with which Vreeland regaled his
<a id="png.122" href="#png.122"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>120<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>soul, as he drove down to Wall Street and found the
two responsible men there on duty.</p>

<p>Noel Endicott, with Aubrey Maitland, were in a
secret junta busily opening the new set of books.</p>

<p>The finely assumed carelessness of Vreeland covered
his desire to trace and locate the only man he
feared—Mr. Horton Wyman.</p>

<p>“Just write your dispatch,” calmly said Endicott.
“I’ll send it down to Washington to Alynton’s private
secretary, and you’ll have Wyman’s answer at
once. They are inspecting some of Alynton’s West
Virginia properties.”</p>

<p>And, in truth, an open answer to Vreeland’s holiday
greeting was at the Waldorf when the schemer
finished his New Year’s dinner, and slipped out to
visit the lair where a wrinkled hag guarded Justine
Duprez’ convenient <i lang="fr">pied à terre</i>.</p>

<p>He marveled long over a second dispatch which
awaited him there. Its words were ominous, and
yet, Elaine Willoughby was firm and steadfast in her
purpose.</p>

<p>“She has been greatly excited. Doctor Alberg has
been telegraphed for. You are to come to-morrow.
Lawyer leaves to-night. Dare not communicate by
letter. I have the most important news.”</p>

<p>And all night Harold Vreeland was tossed about in
a vain unrest.</p>

<p>He knew that his greedy accomplice Justine would
easily handle and draw out Alberg, for, not of a
jealous disposition, Vreeland was perfectly willing
that the doctor should be made a tool of the facile
Parisienne.</p>

<p>“You know how to lead him on, Justine,” was Vreeland’s
easy-going hint, whereat the demure maid
<a id="png.123" href="#png.123"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>121<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dropped her lashes and smiled. And after all, even
the artful Justine was only means to an end.</p>

<p>The recurring excitement of the tortured lonely
rich woman was only a new phase of the old invincible
mystery. “Can it be a gigantic game of blackmail,
the infamous price of someone’s silence—the bribe to
her quiet enjoyment of a station not her own? What
hideous Frankenstein hides behind the dropped arras
of her life?”</p>

<p>Vreeland knew how many dark shadows lurked
behind the bright curtains of New York’s Belgravia
and Mayfair.</p>

<p>“By God! I shall know soon!” he growled, as the
second day of the new year brought him the dispatch
confirming Justine’s watchful foresight. There was
no uncertain ring to the words of the Lady of Lakemere.</p>

<p>“Come to me at once! Immediate action necessary!”</p>

<p>“It seems to be something recurrent—something,
too, that even golden-massed money can not help! She
would quickly brush this trouble away, if the ‘long
green’ would do it. And, it must be something which
that old fox, Endicott, can not help, or he would stay up
there on guard and help it, instead of leaving her to Dr. Hugo Alberg’s chloral, chlorodyne, and phenacetine.
There must be an ugly snarl—some olden shame, some
hidden disgrace.”</p>

<p>Vreeland very well knew that the sly German practitioner’s
drugs had brought his patient “no surcease
of sorrow,” but only “pushed the clouds along” to
a new day of reactionary misery. For, the proud heart
was sealed and yet surcharged almost to its breaking.</p>

<p>“I wonder what our opinion of each other would be
<a id="png.124" href="#png.124"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>122<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>if we all had to walk abroad with our life stories openly
branded on our faces?” mused the anxious Vreeland,
as he drove away to the station. The flying wheels of
the coupé seemed to clatter “Not much! Not much!
Nothing at all!” He meanly believed all men and
women to be as base at heart as himself.</p>

<p>“Thank Fortune for the decent lies of a smooth
appearance and a still tongue!” was the schemer’s
cheering conclusion, as he finally dismissed all vain
moralizing, and then, wondered how he would meet
the crafty Justine first, and so be able to gain her
budget of stolen tidings before he faced the watchful
Lady of Lakemere.</p>

<p>The provokingly suggestive face of the French
woman met him at the front door, on his arrival. “I
am to see that you have your breakfast,” she smilingly
said, “while Doctor Alberg, now upstairs, prepares
Madame for your visit!”</p>

<p>And, as she drew him into a coign of vantage, she
whispered, “He is now my very slave! For he, too, is
hunting for an ally, and I had him all to myself last
evening! Now for the news! You can afford to
be liberal to me!”</p>

<p>Her eyes were beaming with that vicious triumph
of an unfaithful underling discovering the naked soul
of her helpless mistress.</p>

<p>The household traitor is the lowest of all human
spawn.</p>

<p>“Tell me everything,” was Vreeland’s hurried
response. “When I marry her, I will be the King of
the Street, and you shall stay with us as long as you
wish—it will be always the same between us.”</p>

<p>The woman’s gleaming eyes softened in a glow of
triumph.</p>

<p><a id="png.125" href="#png.125"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>123<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“And, your house at Paris shall be my <i lang="fr">pied à terre</i>.
But, give me every word—remember!”</p>

<p>His bosom was rent with thronging hopes and fears.</p>

<p>Justine smiled, as she pressed herself close to the
handsome scoundrel.</p>

<p>“It is a bargain, then. I will hold you to every
word, and I will never let you go. How I secreted
myself so as to hear them, is my own business. But
I did. In their fear of Doctor Alberg, whom Endicott
heartily despises, they fell easily into my hands.
There was much talk of the child—a girl—a missing
girl—her child—but no time or age was given—no
whisper of the father’s name.”</p>

<p>Justine paused, while Vreeland hoarsely whispered,
“Go on! Go on! Quick! She may send any moment
for me, now!”</p>

<p>“It appears she had placed her child, to get rid of it,
in a ‘private Orphan Asylum’ here, in the city. Just
why—I can not tell. But, they have lost all traces
of the girl.</p>

<p>“The old man said, ‘I have followed up every “private
inquiry” possible, since your orders of last summer.
These detective fellows all come to me for their money
on the New Year. Now you must be brave, Elaine,’
he said, and I could hear her choking sobs.</p>

<p>“‘I have very bad news.’</p>

<p>“‘She is dead?’ almost screamed Madame.</p>

<p>“From my little peep-hole, I could see the old
lawyer take her hands.</p>

<p>“‘We have been led away on a blind trail. And I
have only just now found the right one—but to lose it
forever, I fear. For one of my best agents has discovered
that Doctor McLloyd’s private Orphan Asylum
<a id="png.126" href="#png.126"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>124<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was chased out of New York City by some angry rivals,
and a bevy of too inquisitive reporters.</p>

<p>“‘The Doctor was making money too fast, and
there was a very suspicious mortality among the little
girls. It reappeared as the “House of the Good Samaritan,”
at a little village in Westchester County. The old
Doctor has gone either to his reward, or punishment.
Probably, the latter.</p>

<p>“‘But the sly hypocrite who sported a D. D., as well
as a medical title, left the Westchester property to a
buxom grass widow, who long officiated as his matron.</p>

<p>“‘This woman is now forty years old—well-to-do—and
is married to a thrifty young farmer—a man
who is not particular as to how she earned the
handsome property which they enjoy.’</p>

<p>“Mrs. Willoughby was softly sobbing when he
finished.</p>

<p>“‘By the lavish use of money and a compact of
immunity, she agreed to privately examine the books
and records. Of course <em>she has not got them</em>. “It is a
friend—and so on.” We did not dare to force her.
For, she is a very sly bird.</p>

<p>“‘She was only twenty-two when she eased the
good Doctor’s lonely hours, and she is a remarkably
cool hand at the game of life.’</p>

<p>“The old man sighed, as he said, ‘It appears that
the enthusiastic childless woman, who first adopted
the child, died in two years after your babe was taken
away from the “private Orphan Asylum,” and, as her
young husband remarried in a year, he brought the
pretty child back and left her again on McLloyd’s
hands—with a handsome present.</p>

<p>“‘The girl was a beautiful three-year-old fairy, and
the “matron” remembers her especially. But, McLloyd,
<a id="png.127" href="#png.127"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>125<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>always anxious for profit, gave her to the first decent
applicants, a respectable childless couple, from Western
New York.</p>

<p>“‘Under the name of “Alva Whiting”—full
orphan—she was sent away for the second time.</p>

<p>“‘I must find her! You must advertise!’ cried
Madame.</p>

<p>“‘Ah!’ said the old lawyer. ‘There is no hope.
The young widower came back, after his second
wedding was all safe, returning from a three years’
visit in Europe. By a strange chance, his later union
was also childless.</p>

<p>“‘Rich, and now thoroughly independent, he, too,
wished to trace “Alva Whiting,” and to reclaim her.</p>

<p>“‘But the matron says that even the wily McLloyd,
tempted by a handsome reward, failed to find her.
The Western New York people may have given a
false name, to prevent the child from ever knowing
that she was not their own.</p>

<p>“‘That is all—the matron would gladly earn our
offered money—she knows nothing.</p>

<p>“‘And now, God alone can, in his infinite mercy,
ever reclaim “Alva Whiting.”</p>

<p>“‘I have tried to induce this woman to meet me.
She flatly told my agent that she would have all the
books burned—and then, deny everything—if her prosperous
middle age was connected with old McLloyd’s
baby farm. She cried, “I’m as fond of money as
anyone—but there’s the end of it.”</p>

<p>“‘No more would she say. I fear there is no
hope.’ The old lawyer was almost in tears, as he saw
Madame’s sufferings.</p>

<p>“Now,” whispered Justine, “I merely saved my
place by that agility of body which you have so often
<a id="png.128" href="#png.128"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>126<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>praised. When Madame fell in a dead faint, and the
old lawyer screamed for help, I just ran around the
hall, knocking over a table, and—the rest has been
left in Doctor Alberg’s hands. So, you now know
all.” The schemer’s brain was working like lightning
as they parted in silence.</p>

<p>After the breakfast, it was Justine who conducted
Vreeland to Madame Willoughby’s morning room—but
not until Doctor Alberg had first waylaid him.</p>

<p>“The same old mystery!” the German sighed.</p>

<p>“Money trouble it can not be.”</p>

<p>He flourished his arm in the direction of the fortune
in art and bibelots scattered around.</p>

<p>“Her general system is without disease. Her mind
and self-control are perfect. She has no concealed bad
habits, like the ‘suffering New York dames,’” he
sneered. “But always periodical violent storms of
sorrow, these violent attacks following old Endicott’s
business visits.</p>

<p>“There must be some old bug-a-boo. Now, I
know lonely women are often apt to be hysterical.</p>

<p>“Marry her. Take her away to Europe. Make her
happy. She is a Venus de Melos, yet in her prime.
Break off the domination of this old legal crab.</p>

<p>“Marriage reveals all secrets, finally. You will surely
break his hold on her. You are no sentimentalist.
I will prescribe marriage—do you see? We will work
together. I will be your ally—your slave—your
friend.</p>

<p>“You can well afford to be generous, and you then
can work me in, as confidential physician, into that
golden New York circle where the women’s confidence
once gained, a man need not look further for a
Golconda.</p>

<p><a id="png.129" href="#png.129"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>127<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Discretion, silence, and a willingness to go
through fire to hide any woman’s secrets—<i lang="fr">voilà</i>—the
perfect doctor—the successful medical man! Shall
we work together—you and I?”</p>

<p>The young schemer grasped the greedy German’s
hand. “I’ll stop at nothing—to help you. By God!
you shall have her every secret.”</p>

<p>“It’s a go. Loyal to the end,” whispered Vreeland.</p>

<p>“And you and I breakfast at Martin’s every Sunday
till I am a happy bridegroom.”</p>

<p>The alert physician glided away to where Justine
Duprez’s eyes called him, with their velvety lure.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland’s face was lit up with a tender
sympathy, as he knelt before the fair woman who lay
in a <i lang="fr">chaise longue</i> before her superbly sculptured fireplace.
There was a surprise in store for “the knight
of the ribbon blue.” His patroness’ face was stoically
calm. She was no hysterical weakling!</p>

<p>With a perfect self-possession, she plunged at once
into the “business in hand.”</p>

<p>“A modern mystery,” he murmured. “A sphinx
of the heart,” for Elaine Willoughby, Napoleon-like,
ignored her ailments, whether of a mere passing weakness
or “memory’s rooted sorrow.” And at what
secret cost?</p>

<p>“Time presses!” she said. “Follow my every word.
For, I have sent them all away. There is only Doctor
Alberg in the house—and Justine always keeps him in
her eye.”</p>

<p>Vreeland breathed hard. It dawned upon him that
the universally pliant French woman was in the receipt
of several salaries.</p>

<p>“She is a smart devil,” he thought, with a glow of
pride.</p>

<p><a id="png.130" href="#png.130"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>128<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I shall have to travel some, this spring—in connection
with very important movements and reactions of
a specialty in the stock market, which you alone will
know of.</p>

<p>“You and I must be the only ones to handle the
concealed intimacy of ours. Not even Endicott suspects.</p>

<p>“He never must. No one in the firm. Should
foul play or awkwardness reveal it, the firm name
of Wyman &amp; Vreeland would come down in a day.
So, mark my every word. I will not return to New
York till you are installed in your new apartments in
the Elmleaf.</p>

<p>“It is well located, in the ‘thirties’—I have taken
the best one on the top floor to aid you in the gay
and showy life that I wish you to lead there.</p>

<p>“You will find your new man, Bagley, a veteran
London valet, just brought over, waiting to report to
you now at the Waldorf. He has never been in
America before, and none of our opponents know him.
I had Justine engage him through Low’s Exchange.</p>

<p>“The rooms are already decorated and arranged for
you. They have been ready for a month, and no one
can ever trace the ownership. The whole belongings
are yours.”</p>

<p>Vreeland found a voice. He began his grateful
praise.</p>

<p>She smiled faintly. “Nay! no thanks! It is purely
a business matter. If you wish anything else, give a
list to me. I will transmit it to the furnisher, who
will at once provide. There will be no bills. I hope
that the rooms will please you. Of course, I shall
never see them.”</p>

<p>The young would-be bridegroom noted the cold
<a id="png.131" href="#png.131"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>129<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>dignity of her measured sentences. There was the
thin icy rivulet still between them.</p>

<p>“Mark me now,” she said. “There is a working
room, and a private secretary (a stenographer, typewriter,
and telegraph operator) will attend daily, from
nine until six. The telegraph and private telephone
wire are connected with my rooms in the ‘Circassia.’
There is a duplicate ’phone joining you with ‘Central,’
for your social use.” Vreeland began to take his cue.</p>

<p>“From the café in the Elmleaf, you can have morning
service, and be furnished such entertainment as
you may wish to give. I presume that you dine at
your clubs, or in society. The café accounts will all
come to me.”</p>

<p>She paused, and studied Vreeland’s face closely.</p>

<p>“And, in all this, what am I to do?” he asked
bewildered.</p>

<p>The Lady of Lakemere laughed gaily at his embarrassment.</p>

<p>“You are to move in there, at once. Sign the lease
for a year. Bagley will take charge of you. There
you are to give a jolly house-warming. Call up all
your friends. Do not neglect Merriman, Wiltshire,
and Rutherstone. You are to be pretty gay. These
gentlemen may even bring some of the ladies who
wear diamond garter buckles. So much the better!</p>

<p>“When I return to New York, you are to report to
me at the ‘Circassia,’ and the serious business of your
new life will then begin. The woman whom I will
send to you as secretary is thoroughly reliable, and I
will answer for her fidelity.”</p>

<p>“The woman?” babbled the astounded Vreeland.</p>

<p>“Yes! Miss Mary Kelly—a talented young business
<a id="png.132" href="#png.132"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>130<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>woman of perfect accomplishment, who represents
me.” The voice of the lady was cuttingly clear.</p>

<p>“Her slight lameness alone prevents her being
placed in some position of the greatest trust. That
room only is sacred from all of your rattle-headed
social friends. I trust her implicitly.”</p>

<p>“I begin to understand you,” gravely said Vreeland.</p>

<p>“Under the guise of enjoying my life and living up
to my prosperity, I am to hide the momentous secret
stock business carried on there.”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” soberly said Elaine Willoughby.</p>

<p>“The office business below?” he hesitatingly said.</p>

<p>“Ah! I have given up months to the study of this
new arrangement,” thoughtfully said the Queen of
the Street. “You are to be master of your own
hours.</p>

<p>“Once a day, however, you are to show up at the
downtown office. Wyman knows that you will be
busied at home a great deal. You will have no
awkward questions asked. Endicott will watch the
downtown affair.”</p>

<p>“The firm signature?” he said.</p>

<p>“Will never be used. You will sign ‘Harold Vreeland,
Trustee,’ and the securities handled daily will
be delivered to me at the ‘Circassia,’ on my list of
purchases and sales. Your checks and my daily statements
are to correspond.”</p>

<p>“In other words, I am, as trustee, your hidden
broker?” Vreeland said.</p>

<p>“Under my daily orders,” she gravely answered.
“And you are not to deny that you indulge in private
speculations. You are not even to avoid Hathorn’s
nearest friends.</p>

<p><a id="png.133" href="#png.133"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>131<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Even if Mrs. Volney McMorris should steal into
your breakfast room, or a bevy of the gay young
matrons, or—even a pretty anonyma—your record as
a ‘<i lang="fr">preux chevalier</i>’ in gayest New York will not suffer.
You are to be a young man <i lang="fr">à la mode</i>.” Vreeland
bowed in a grave silence.</p>

<p>That night, when he returned to New York City, to
blindly obey his strange patroness, Vreeland’s bosom
was big with his happy secrets.</p>

<p>“I am to hold the hidden fort ‘of the Sugar
treasure.’”</p>

<p>He divined a bitter campaign against Hathorn. And
he then dreamed a strange, sweet, wicked dream.
Alida Hathorn’s stolen visits—with Justine, perhaps—as
a dark-eyed devil laughing over the downfall
of his enemy’s wife.</p>

<p>“I will make my own little game,” he laughed.</p>

<h3 title="VII. “Plunger” Vreeland’s gay life, “under the rose”"

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p class="chaphead">“PLUNGER” VREELAND’S GAY LIFE, “UNDER
THE ROSE.”</p>


<p>Before the February snows were congealed into
those dirty flakes of ice and street mud which are an
evidence of the “effectiveness” of New York’s Street
Cleaning department, the “top floor” of the Elmleaf
bachelor apartment was considered to set the pace for
the gayest of the bachelor apartments of Gotham.
The hidden programme was even literally carried out.</p>

<p>Outwardly, the daily life of that fortunate individual,
Mr. Harold Vreeland, had undergone little
change. Once a day he duly occupied his desk at the
downtown office, using alternately the morning and
afternoon fraction.</p>

<p>He proved a very “tough nut to crack” for the local
gossips, however. There was a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde flavor of mystery clinging to the audacious
young “Westerner.” The slow trots of the “Locust”
and the old senile wiseacres of the “Sentinel” clubs
wondered at his calm demeanor, his easily acquired
repose of the caste of “Vere de Vere.” Vreeland was
posing now as a “fixed star.”</p>

<p>Not even Bradstreet, or Dun, could seize upon any
public delinquencies to the detriment of his “business
character,” and yet, Harold Vreeland had rapidly
acquired the reputation of a “devil of a fellow.” He
had, like Byron, his “hours of idleness.”</p>

<p>There was, too, an outward prosperous harmony in
<a id="png.135" href="#png.135"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>133<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the busy office of Wyman and Vreeland, now packed
with clerks and forging to the front as a house of
unexampled strength.</p>

<p>There was a sober, quiet effectiveness in the firm,
which shamed the nervous “bucket shop” decadents,
who were only noisy, screaming gulls, clamoring over
the financial sea for “any old thing” in the way of
floating pabulum.</p>

<p>It was undeniable that the hats went off to right and
left, as Vreeland paced the sacred precincts of Wall,
Broad and Pine. A rising man—a successful man—a
man of mark!</p>

<p>“A safe man, sir! A wonderful young financier!
A man whose outside operations are enormous!”
gravely said the cashier of the Mineralogical Bank to
his esteemed colleague, the cashier of Henry Screws &amp;
Company.</p>

<p>“You see!” confidentially said the speaker, between
two mouthfuls of “hasty lunch,” “the house is bound
not to speculate, but—Vreeland, as an individual, is
to-day, perhaps the heaviest single operator of all the
young men of New York.” The young man’s fame
was duly noised abroad.</p>

<p>“Where does he get all his backing?” grunted the
other, as he dashed down a tankard of “bitter.”</p>

<p>“He owns the half of Montana,” dreamily said the
Mineralogical’s Cerberus.</p>

<p>“And so, he is founded on the eternal rocks.”</p>

<p>It was not half an hour until this brilliant new
canard was traveling like a winged locust—and, it
soon achieved the voyage—even to the jungles of
Harlem—and spread all over Gotham like the Canada
thistle attacking a poorhouse farm. A new financial
Napoleon had appeared.</p>

<p><a id="png.136" href="#png.136"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>134<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The self-possessed Vreeland was astounded at the
many offered social honors, the crowding attractive
business temptations, and all the rosy lures now
thronging his pathway. He knew not as yet the
whole force of a lie “well stuck to,” which often
treads down the modest and shamefaced truth.</p>

<p>And even the agnostic sneer of “parvenu” was
spared him. He was suave, careful, chary in making
enemies, and strictly non-committal.</p>

<p>His conduct toward Elaine Willoughby absolutely
disarmed even that vigilant social scavenger, Mrs. Volney McMorris.</p>

<p>For, many other men were just as often seen on parade
in Elaine’s opera box. Senator Alynton, General
Morehouse, U. S. A., Judge Arbuckle, and other social
heavy guns oftener pressed the cushions of her
victoria, or nestled under her sleigh robes.</p>

<p>The Lady of Lakemere’s dinners were always
stocked with a half dozen masculine “lions” of deep-toned
and majestic growl. There were also two or
three society swells—“howling swells”—who represented
the “froth and foam,” and these young men,
with vacuous smiles and heaven-kissing collars,
impartially formed the “bodyguard” at theatre
parties, and a gilded Spartan band, deftly “cleaned
up” the debris of the midnight spread in the Waldorf
supper room.</p>

<p>Elaine had a peculiar fashion of segregating the lions
and dudes, and sending each kind of social animal
forth radiant with self-satisfaction, after a happy five
minutes passed with her alone—in the pearl boudoir.</p>

<p>So, calm and serene, Harold Vreeland duly came
and went. Men wondered that he so freely stood
back to let “other fellows take up the running,” and
<a id="png.137" href="#png.137"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>135<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Augustus Van Renslayer sagely summed up the verdict
of the younger “women hunters” of New York:
“He is no marrying man. He lives in an eternal
picnic of his own—up there—in the Elmleaf.” It
was vaguely understood that Sardanapalus was Vreeland’s
patron saint, and Bacchus and Nero his household
gods. The charm had worked but too well.</p>

<p>And the women of Gotham, those bright-eyed heart-wreckers,
were all fain to agree with the catfish-eyed
Van Renslayer. There was a fatal impartiality in the
easy gallantry of the wary Princeton graduate.</p>

<p>Liberal, dashing, mindful of all the <i lang="fr">petits agrémens<!-- TN: original reads "agremens" --></i>,
he was no woman’s slave—and yet, all women’s
friend. If no single heart quivered at his master
touch, still, there were many arms open to him <i lang="fr">selon
son métier<!-- TN: original reads "mêtier" --></i>. A fatal curiosity led many a pretty
Columbus on voyages of discovery to the Elmleaf—whereat
Bagley duly grinned.</p>

<p>That famous housewarming had been a marvel in
its delicate recognition of the <i lang="fr">monde ou l’on s’ennuie</i>,
and the judicious hilarity of the Demi-Vierges.</p>

<p>For the return of Mr. James Potter, now finally
severed from the flagging firm of Hathorn &amp; Wolfe,
had furnished Vreeland with a brilliant new idea.</p>

<p>There was a superb “First Part,” in which Mrs. Volney McMorris lightly and amiably matronized the
bravest ladies of the “swim”—who had long been
burning to inspect the splendors of the upper floor of
the Elmleaf.</p>

<p>Among the forty guests of the “official” programme,
were such undeniably good form clubmen
as Potter, Wiltshire, Merriman, and Rutherstone.
They and their gilded brothers suggested the names
of willing goddesses, and so it was that Miss Katharine
<a id="png.138" href="#png.138"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>136<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>VanDyke Norreys, the “staccato” Californian heiress—Mrs. Murray Renton, of Cleveland—and several
other detached, semi-detached, and detachable
women “of spotless reputation,” joyed with the
host’s convives, dipped their laughing, rosy lips in
his Roederer, and pattered with their lightly-treading
feet over his airy domain of a wondrously refined
luxury.</p>

<p>It was nearly one o’clock when the grave Bagley
had closed the last carriage door and sent the two
policemen away with “a heavenly smile on their
faces”—and a five-dollar bill clutched in each
brawny hand.</p>

<p>And then, on softly-rolling rubber wheels, came
slipping along under the shadows of clubhouse and
virtuous mansions of drowsy decorum, the pick of
Cupid’s Dashing Free Lances—the very flower of the
Light Infantry of Love. This “Pickett’s charge” of
these demure Demi-Vierges was successful.</p>

<p>It was the solemn Bagley who marveled as he sped
these “shining ones” on their way up the stair at the
struggling odors of “Y’lang Y’lang,” “Atkinson’s
White Rose,” “Wood Violets,” and “Peau d’Espagne.”</p>

<p>For days, that scented staircase recalled the
“informal visit” of the regent moon, Miss Dickie
Doubleday; the audacious Tottie Thistledown, the
fair queen of light heels; Nannie Bell, the <i lang="fr">mignonne
chanteuse</i>, and several other disciples of the “partly”
and, alas, the “altogether.” The girdle of Venus was
<i lang="fr">en évidence</i> that happy night.</p>

<p>It is true that the glass globes automatically shrank
up in affright toward the ceiling, as these flashing-eyed
birds fluttered in and burst upon the gay banquet
<a id="png.139" href="#png.139"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>137<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“mid the bright bowls.” The Elmleaf never sheltered
a lighter-hearted crew.</p>

<p>It was left to the imperturbable Bagley, next day,
“to gather up the fragments,” and headaches, heartaches,
and visions of “woven paces and waving arms,”—with
sky-pointed toes and glimpses <i lang="la">ne quid nimis</i>
of clocked stockings and sleek tricots, were fairly
divided among the gallant swains who “did not go
home till morning.”</p>

<p>It was in this jovial manner that Vreeland vindicated
the public character of <i lang="fr">un homme galant</i>,
which his strange feverish-hearted patroness seemed
to thrust upon him. And he wondered as he obeyed—but,
the game went bravely on.</p>

<p>There were some seriously tender interludes in the
“evening’s hilarity.” Miss Dickie Doubleday, in
the <i lang="fr">empanchement de son âme<!-- TN: original reads "áme" --></i> and, watchfully jealous
of that dimpled star, Stella Knox, had quickly
effected a truce, of an amatory character, with the
loved and lost Jimmie Potter, who had lived to learn
that her heart was “a bicycle made for two”—if not
more.</p>

<p>“After the ball,” Potter ostentatiously lingered to
smoke a last weed with Vreeland, who had opened
for him alone the last unprofaned corner of his
domain—that Bluebeard chamber which was “strictly
business.” He knew that Potter was secret, safe,
and gamely silent.</p>

<p>“Ah! my boy!” sighed Potter. “I see how you
carry on your own private plunging. What a fool
Hathorn was—to quarrel with the Willoughby!</p>

<p>“Now that I’m out I don’t mind to tell you that
the old firm is going downhill very fast. Hathorn
lost his luck when he cut the golden cord.</p>

<p><a id="png.140" href="#png.140"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>138<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I can’t make him out. He has grown strangely
reckless and haggard.</p>

<p>“And the wife is, to say the least, <i lang="fr">un peu insouciante</i>.
You know of that little yacht racket?”—and
he whispered a few telling words.</p>

<p>“Well! Alida Hathorn was the Veiled Lady.
I have it from the man who is to be the sailing master
of the ‘Aphrodite’ next year.</p>

<p>“And the blinded Hathorn is obstinately shadowing
Mrs. Willoughby, still following up her game,
digging up her past, and backing up all his wife’s
acidulated slanders.</p>

<p>“When I found this to be a truth, and saw these
damned guttersnipe Hawkshaws slipping in and out
of his private office, I decided to quietly withdraw—for
a quieter and a gamer woman never drew breath
than Elaine Willoughby.</p>

<p>“I wish to God that I had married Alida,” burst out
the honest reveler, whose relaxed nerves had unsealed
the fountains of truth. “For now, I fear, she will be
every man’s woman—if she don’t pull up. She’s left
all alone, and Hathorn’s one idea is revenge upon
Elaine Willoughby.</p>

<p>“And for her sake, he bitterly hates you. Look
out for him. For he has lost all self-control. You
are wise to play your outside game here in safety.
Hathorn would not hesitate to bribe your own people.</p>

<p>“I know he had that big lump of deviltry, Justine
Duprez, in his pay. He even took her over to Paris
the summer Mrs. Willoughby went out to Colorado.
I’m glad I’m out of the stock business. You’ll tire of
it, and with your money why do you fool with it?”</p>

<p>The young Crœsus arose unsteadily, and said,
“Come to breakfast with me at the Union to-morrow—that
<a id="png.141" href="#png.141"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>139<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>is to say, to-day,” he chuckled. “Well, let us
have one hour’s poker—you and me—and with no
limit—just for fun.</p>

<p>“You owe me a revenge. Now, remember—I have
warned you. Look out that Hathorn don’t get onto
your little game—dig a pit—and drop you in it.</p>

<p>“He’s grown to be an ether drinker now, and
his wife is as cold-hearted an egoist as breathes. Just
dead gone on herself—and her own pretty bodily
mechanism. If he ever gets in an ugly money corner,
she won’t give him a sou marqué.</p>

<p>“Now, Elaine Willoughby has ‘held up her end of
the log’ against some of the stiffest men in Wall
Street. She is smarter than a whole stack of
Hathorns. I know in the outside companies that I
am director of, she has loads of the best paying permanent
investments.</p>

<p>“And if she ever catches Hathorn nosing into her
affairs, or yours, for I know your firm does a part of
her business, she will smash up Fred Hathorn like the
‘Mary Powell’ going over a rowboat.”</p>

<p>With an affected unconcern, Vreeland saw his
friend disappear in a night hour club coupé, after
swearing fidelity to the poker tryst.</p>

<p>But his heart was beating wildly, as he crawled
upstairs in the gray of the dawn. “That’s her game;
defense and revenge! I wonder if Hathorn really
traced her out to Colorado, and has he an inkling of
Alva Whiting?</p>

<p>“He’s not above levying a blackmail. And I am in
some strange way her pawn in this veiled duel to the
death, a duel between a man and woman who may
have often rested in each other’s arms with vows of
deathless love.</p>

<p><a id="png.142" href="#png.142"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>140<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“It may be only self-protection that made her shove
him off on Alida VanSittart. How she hurried on
that marriage?</p>

<p>“Was it jealousy, fear, or some of her craft? And
I am used—used and only half trusted.</p>

<p>“Wait! Lady Mine! If Justine only plays me fair, I
will have got all your game—and then I’ll be master
of you, Lakemere and the money. Once inside
your lines, then you will never be able to throw me
off.” He was beginning to see the threads of the
swift current now.</p>

<p>His own expression, “inside your lines,” haunted
him through his three hours’ sleep, his bath, and early
breakfast. Vreeland had the nerves of the Iron
Duke, and he burned for a few words with Justine,
who was to seek him that very morning, at her nest
in South Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>For there was a southward trip impending, and he
wished to give his one faithful spy her orders.</p>

<p>“If I could only get at the wires in her room! If I
could only manage to tap her talk and messages to
old Endicott! For this woman here in the office
is surely her spy. Bagley may be.</p>

<p>“By Heavens! There is just one chance. And her
mail! Justine may help me. What can she not do?”</p>

<p>His heart burned with a dull jealousy of that past
when Justine had aided Hathorn on his upward way.
“If she could only get around the janitor of the
‘Circassia,’ and the letter carrier. What money can
do, I can aid her in, and she must do the rest—” He
closed his eyes in a fierce glow of sensual irritation,
for the Parisienne had already forged chains upon him
which, with all his cold craft, he could not lightly
break away from.</p>

<p><a id="png.143" href="#png.143"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>141<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“She is not to be resisted—if she plays her own
game. First the trip, then the other idea. But I
could never handle this pale-faced St. Agnes—this
lame bundle of all the virtues. I must have some one
else here to watch Miss Mary Kelly—this convent-bred
marvel.</p>

<p>“Why not find a smart woman to be my private stenographer
and one of the right kind? She could also
keep an eye on Bagley and the little dove-eyed
devotee. Justine may help me to the right woman.
I’ll tell her all.” He began to see Lakemere moving
toward him.</p>

<p>The gilded child of fashion was first at the tryst, and
Justine Duprez threw herself into her secret lover’s
arms with a glad cry of triumph, when ten o’clock
brought her to the meeting place. “If I could only
come to you,” she fiercely sighed—“in your palace
home!</p>

<p>“But wait—wait—till we have netted my lady. I
have news now to make your heart dance.”</p>

<p>The panting woman drew from her breast a scrawl
of paper, on which she had copied even the office marks.
“This telegram came this morning. You see that it
is dated Washington.” Vreeland’s heart bounded as
he read the words: “Arlington—to-morrow. Don’t
fail.” Was it an appointment—a lover’s secret call?</p>

<p>He could have shouted with triumph, as he gazed
on the signature, “Alynton,” for a messenger had
brought him a note at the moment of his departure
to meet Justine. His patroness had fallen into a
snare.</p>

<p>“I am going to Pittsburg to-night. Come up and
dine. I will give you your orders for a week.”</p>

<p>He drew out the note, and glanced at the firm pen
<a id="png.144" href="#png.144"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>142<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>stroke. “Can Alynton be the father of Alva Whiting?”
he growled.</p>

<p>He dropped his head on the table, while Justine took
off her hat and wraps with the easy insouciance of
a Camille. He was mad with mingled greed and
jealousy.</p>

<p>“Perhaps! Alynton’s father was an irascible
magnate of enormous wealth. They are about the
same age. He may have feared his father’s wrath,
for he naturally should make a political marriage.
Ah! my lady, you have lied to me.</p>

<p>“If it is not the old secret of two guilty hearts,
then there is the gordian knot of the great Sugar
intrigue in this.”</p>

<p>His thoughts thronged upon him with lightning
rapidity, and as her head lay on his arm, he gave
the triumphant Frenchwoman her orders.</p>

<p>“Our whole future hangs on your adroitness. You
must find out what goes on between them. In a
hotel you have a far better chance than in either of
her two homes.”</p>

<p>Vreeland murmured that in her ears which made
the vicious woman’s cheeks redden.</p>

<p>“Bah! all we women are alike,” she sneered. “But
if she slyly sends me out?” There was a gloomy
pause.</p>

<p>“I do not think that she suspects you,” finally
answered Vreeland. “Telegraph me here what you
dare to.</p>

<p>“And bring me all the other news in person. Now,
tell me all you know of this very saintly young Mary
Kelly.”</p>

<p>His voice had the ring of anxiety. “I have had the
janitor and the letter-carrier watch her. They are
<a id="png.145" href="#png.145"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>143<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>both friends of mine,” modestly murmured Justine.</p>

<p>“She lives near us, on a side street, with her old
mother. And never goes out with a man, except
Officer Daly. Daly, the Roundsman. A <i lang="fr">beau garçon</i>,
too; but it may be only a flirtation <i lang="fr">Catholique à
l’Irelandaise</i>.</p>

<p>“I have often followed her myself to church. And
she comes once a week to Madame. They always
look over papers together.”</p>

<p>“And that smug devil Bagley,” cried Vreeland,
“only comes to the door, leaves me the <i lang="fr">pacquet</i> of
bills, and does not even see Madame. He gets an
order for the money, and then returns later with the
receipted bills.”</p>

<p>Justine was back at the Circassia before Vreeland
left her rooms to engage in his little joust at poker
with Mr. James Potter, whose morning diet of red
pepper, cracked ice, and soda water had at last
brought him up to the normal, after several sporadic
cocktails.</p>

<p>All through the quiet duel of cards, Vreeland was
haunted by the twin obstacles, Bagley and Miss Mary
Kelly. “Bagley is a perfect servant, and I can not get
any excuse to rid myself of him. My secrets are
not kept where he can reach them,” mused Vreeland.</p>

<p>“The girl I surely dare not displace; but I can
get around them both, if I have the right kind of a
woman here near me. I have the excuse of my ‘outside
correspondence’ and social affairs.</p>

<p>“Miss Kelly is sacred to the affairs of this cool-headed
patroness of mine. And even Elaine can not
object.</p>

<p>“It would ‘give away’ her veiled espionage on me.
Yes, that’s the plan! I can advertise; pick one or two
<a id="png.146" href="#png.146"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>144<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>out of a hundred women and then <em>try them on</em>,” he
craftily smiled, “and only begin my real operations
when I have found the right one and the two young
women have struck up an intimacy.” He laughed.
“My pretty spy shall watch the placid young saint.”</p>

<p>Vreeland tossed upon his bed that night, and
reflected upon the singular methods of his covert
business.</p>

<p>A list of stocks sent to him by messenger, or
personally delivered by Mrs. Willoughby, to be
bought and sold, with seemingly no guiding rule;
all the checks signed only by him as “Harold Vreeland,
Trustee,” and all the securities daily deposited,
after due receipt and tag, in Mrs. Willoughby’s steel
vault compartment at the Mineralogical Bank. And
she alone knew of gain or loss. He was only a
gilded dummy.</p>

<p>But one great house guarded all these covert
transactions, and the deliveries to them, in case of
sales, were always made by an order on the cashier
of the Mineralogical.</p>

<p>A dozen times the wily schemer had verified that
Mrs. Willoughby knew all the details of each purchase
or delivery long before his own daily report.</p>

<p>For when her account was actively moving, once a
day the mistress and her secret agent always met.</p>

<p>But never had Elaine Willoughby’s foot mounted
the broad steps of the Elmleaf, neither had the
luxury-loving man ever dared to yield to Justine’s
mad desire to visit him in his splendid new home.</p>

<p>“It would be simply a financial suicide—our joint
ruin!” he had whispered.</p>

<p>“But wait—wait till I marry her!”</p>

<p>And then, their chiming laughter ended the daring
<a id="png.147" href="#png.147"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>145<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>woman’s pleadings. For the time was to come when
the fortune of the generous dupe would be ruled by
the victorious young Napoleon.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland knew, in his heart, that the Queen
of the Street was aware of the wild daily life of the
men in the Elmleaf.</p>

<p>For after rout-ball, opera, and theatre there were
often stolen visits, aided by the friendly mantle of
darkness, and diamonds which had gleamed but an
hour before on calm and unsullied brows at the
opera glittered balefully in the crepuscular gloom of
shaded rooms, where at least one of the passionate
lovers was far away from home.</p>

<p>The schemer had, from the first, avoided all intimacies
with these light-headed men.</p>

<p>He knew that each of his fellow <i lang="fr">locataires</i> was a Don
Juan, and that tragedy and comedy, sweet sin with
shame, were traveling fast upon its heels and satiety
stalking along; that aching brows upon rose-leaf
couches haunted the decorous interiors of this abode
of hidden pleasures. The Elmleaf was a Golgotha of
reputations.</p>

<p>And only a fire or an earthquake could reveal the
daringly desperate <i lang="fr">liaisons</i>, which, urged on by the
delightful zest of danger, would have made public, by
any sudden disaster, a story far more ghastly than
the untold record of that hideous night when the
Hotel Royal went up in fire and flame.</p>

<p>It was in a dull resentment against Elaine, and
spurred on by Potter’s tipsy confidence, that Vreeland,
now fearing nothing, drew Mrs. Alida Hathorn
aside as he met her by hazard once more in the reception
room of the Savoy. He was waiting for a
momentary telegram from Justine, when his eyes
<a id="png.148" href="#png.148"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>146<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>rested upon the alluring moonlight glances of that
provoking young beauty, Mrs. Fred Hathorn. When
she had gaily rallied him on the Sardanapalian
splendor of his Elmleaf establishment, he whispered
in burning words: “Why do you not ever come and
see it?”</p>

<p>The costly fan trembled and snapped in her hand as
she slowly said: “I wanted to ask you something
to-day! <em>The time has come!</em>”</p>

<p>“With Mrs. McMorris?” she whispered, vaguely
pointing toward his spider parlor.</p>

<p>“Without Mrs. McMorris,” the ardent pleading
voice replied.</p>

<p>“I will tell you all. <em>I will lay my life at your feet!</em>”</p>

<p>Alida Hathorn pouted. “I will never find my way.”
Her tone was that of light raillery, but her cheeks
were deadly pale. She was trembling on the brink
of her ruin.</p>

<p>And then, Vreeland, taking her hands in his,
whispered to her words whereat the busy familiar
devil at his side laughed in glee.</p>

<p>“If you mean to say yes,” he murmured, “give me
that red rose from your breast.”</p>

<p>And when he raised his head, the rose in his hand
was the pledge of a dark tryst of the devil’s own
making.</p>

<p>Before he slept, for his throbbing heart would not
down in the crowning victory of his revenge upon the
desperate Hathorn, he tore open a telegram which
marked another milestone of his life.</p>

<p>“<em>Victory!</em>” he cried, for the words told him of
Justine’s success.</p>

<p class="quote">“They dined to-day alone at the place named, and I have news
for you. Coming home, by Pittsburg.”</p>

<p><a id="png.149" href="#png.149"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>147<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The overjoyed scoundrel cried: “Potter was
right, after all. Everything comes round to the
man who waits.”</p>

<p>For a study of the great journals told him of a
forthcoming report fixing the policy of the Government
upon the tariff.</p>

<p>“If she has the secret, she will surely act upon it,”
he cried. “That ties her to the great Sugar Trust’s
secret service. Perhaps he trusts her on account of
the old love.</p>

<p>“Justine shall wrest the proofs from her by either
fair means or foul. And, as for to-morrow night—”
His lips were parched and dry as he thought of the
light foot slipping up the stairway of the Elmleaf—“not
with Mrs. McMorris!” He seemed to be
wrapped in a golden whirlwind of success.</p>

<p>“If she comes once <em>when she wishes to</em>, she will
come again <em>when I wish her to</em>!” gloated the schemer,
whose mind was now fixed upon detaching Bagley upon
some trumped-up errand and making such a feast as
“Rose in bloom” laid out when the hoodwinked
“Shah Jehan” was “away” at his palace of Ispahan.</p>

<p>“I now hold the cards, and I shall be the victor at last
in this game of life,” he swore, as he dreamed of those
pleading moonlight eyes.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland waited for two days in a fever of
excitement for some mandate from his artful
patroness. “She is a sly one at heart, after all, is
Mme. Elaine,” he growled. “Her stay ‘at Pittsburg’
is only to throw me off my guard, and perhaps
Hathorn.</p>

<p>“She may have taken any one of a dozen short roads
to steal back from her rendezvous with her senatorial
confidant. Friend or lover—<em>which?</em>”</p>

<p><a id="png.150" href="#png.150"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>148<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>He groaned in helpless rage. His mean spirit, his
hidden vicious agnosticism, made him doubt every
woman.</p>

<p>To him they were all the same! The biting words
of that crooked, malignant genius, Pope, came back:
“Every woman is at heart a rake.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! I have found them all to be living behind
imitation fronts,” he snarled.</p>

<p>He was seated in his office watching the pale-faced
and silent Mary Kelly, when a street messenger
arrived with a card sealed in an ordinary telegraph
envelope.</p>

<p>It bore only these words, scrawled by the artful
Frenchwoman: “Come over to the room.”</p>

<p>Stealing a watchful glance at the silent girl in the
office, Vreeland hastened away. He had never been
able to approach the slightest intimacy with the
gray-eyed Irish-American girl.</p>

<p>“Her convent shyness backs up her convent
modesty,” sneered Vreeland, who dared not covertly
insult his patroness’ protégé.</p>

<p>Plaintively handsome, her steadfast eyes gleaming
with a patient resignation, the pale cheeks and
slender form told of a life of semi-invalidism. When
not employed on her fashionable master’s business,
she was ever busied copying literary manuscripts or
legal documents.</p>

<p>“She’s another cool hand,” vulgarly imagined the
upstart schemer.</p>

<p>“She knows that she is safe as long as Mrs. Willoughby
is at the other end of that private wire.</p>

<p>“But, perhaps this Daly, the Roundsman, may
some day bring a glow to those cheeks. They are
<a id="png.151" href="#png.151"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>149<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>all alike—mistress and maid—here in hot-hearted,
wicked New York.</p>

<p>“This one’s only a neat, sly little sneak, and a spy
on me.”</p>

<p>Vreeland’s every nerve was tingling as he dashed
up the stairs to Justine’s nest on South Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>Standing ready for instant departure, the excited
girl told him of how she had stolen away while her
fatigued mistress slept.</p>

<p>“You will hear from her at once—probably to
come up to-night. Now, once for all, <em>there is no love
between them</em>. I found my way as usual. Only business—<em>great
business</em>—<span class="allsc">MONEY AFFAIRS</span>—the play of the
stocks. He is to come up in a month and bring a new
Senator from the West.</p>

<p>“One of the secret friends; so, <i lang="fr">mon ami</i>, you may
soon have another rival.”</p>

<p>Vreeland gnashed his teeth as the girl said: “They
dined together—alone—and talked for hours. Senator
Alynton gave her a paper after they had talked about
the Government, about lawsuits and troubles, and
that I sewed up in her corset for her in her presence
before we left. Brother and sister they are, in friendship,
but he never even raised her hand to his lips.
<i lang="fr">Elle est bien bête, trop bête, pour l’amour!</i>” was Justine’s
parting fling.</p>

<p>“You and I must get that paper, or a copy of it. It’s
our fortune!” he cried. But, Justine had fled, only
adding: “She saw no other man. She only went
there to meet Alynton. Now, back to your rooms.
She will soon call for you.”</p>

<p>Justine was a true prophetess, for while Vreeland
sat in his rooms immersed in the study of a dozen
newspaper articles upon an ominous flurry in the
<a id="png.152" href="#png.152"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>150<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“Sugar” securities, the lame girl tapped at his door.
With a bow, she handed him the transcribed telephone
message: “Please come up at once. Very important.”</p>

<p>“Compliments, and say that I’ll leave instantly,”
gravely replied Vreeland, without lifting his head.</p>

<p>As he hurried on toward the Circassia, he endeavored
to frame some idea of the daring woman speculator’s
plans.</p>

<p>There were rumors of unfavorable tariff action, of
hostile legislation, of adverse decisions of the courts
to be expected, of a growing agitation against the
“Sugar Trust,” and even of the desire of the great
Standard Oil Company to force the value of “Sugar
shares” down by the pressure of their heavily-armed
capitalistic secret brokers, and to “gobble” a controlling
interest, or at least the bulk of the heavy holdings.</p>

<p>“This surely means a slaughter of the little fishes,”
mused Vreeland.</p>

<p>Rumors of a reincorporation of the seventy-five
million dollar capitalized company in New Jersey,
the threatened move to divide its capital stock into
common and preferred, were rife on the Street.</p>

<p>“Ah!” growled Vreeland, as he glanced over a
tabulated statement of the ratings since its organization.
“This may either send the stock, now at
seventy, down to forty or fifty, or up to a hundred
and twenty-five. If I only knew?”</p>

<p>He laughed mockingly as he dismissed the subject.
“It will only be double or quits.”</p>

<p>“Double their wealth for the insiders—and quits
for the poor devils squeezed to the wall!” While he
waited in the drawing-room for his patroness, the
woman whom he began to fear he never would make
<a id="png.153" href="#png.153"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>151<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>his dupe or slave, he pondered over her real purposes
in the vast hidden speculations.</p>

<p>“Has she not already money enough?” he enviously
thought, gazing on the heaped-up splendors of
costly taste around him. And then, he remembered
that he had never met any man, woman, or child in
New York City who had money enough.</p>

<p>“It’s the fashionable craze—money-getting, by hook
or crook,” he reflected.</p>

<p>“And once mixed up in the game, it’s hard for her
to leave it, especially if she is the go-between who
links some of the nation’s statesmen to the great
insiders of the Trust.</p>

<p>“This home may be only a sham, Lakemere only a
way station for the friendly conspirators, and that
paper may be a dangerous document which neither
side would dare to hold. And old Endicott, too—what’s
his rôle?”</p>

<p>He was the more interested as Justine had swept
away all suspicions of an <i lang="fr">amourette</i> between the two
whom he feared.</p>

<p>“Still there is the lost child. If I only knew how
old the girl was,” he fretted.</p>

<p>“It may be the child of the last decade, or the fruit
of a girlish marriage. That secret, and the paper, I
must have.</p>

<p>“But, Justine must steal the one, and I have got to
reach her line of secret communications.”</p>

<p>As he met his calmly-smiling secret employer he
could not divine the revengeful purposes hidden
under her gently-heaving bosom.</p>

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p class="chaphead">MISS ROMAINE GARLAND, STENOGRAPHER.</p>


<p>It was late that night when the excited Vreeland left
the Circassia and he was still somewhat in the dark as
to the real object of his veiled employment. He
reasoned justly that there was not a grain of sentiment
now in the frankly defined relations between himself
and the Lady of Lakemere.</p>

<p>The money bond between them was only that cold
one of employer and employed, and the unmistakable
dignity of Elaine’s business manner held him decidedly
aloof. Here was no lover’s thrall.</p>

<p>Not a single reference to her absence had escaped
her lips. There was no pleasant, social white-lying
going on between them, and he was still in the dark
when he left, with the strictest orders to await every
moment between ten and three, her signal for the
beginning of stock operations of gigantic magnitude.</p>

<p>“This Sugar stock may pay twelve and seven per
cent on common and preferred in a year, or else be
driven down to half price. We must be wary,” she
sighed. “No one can truly forecast the actions of our
courts, journals, electors or government,” she mused.
“The very principle of reckless instability is the one
sure thing of all our American doings.”</p>

<p>“And yet, you move along with the others,
Madonna,” smilingly said Vreeland.</p>

<p>“You shall see,” she laughed. “The stock market,
the sea, and a woman’s heart are never at rest.
Always distrust the seeming calm.</p>

<p><a id="png.155" href="#png.155"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>153<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Now,” her voice became grave, “you are to be,
each instant, ready at the post of duty. You will personally
telephone your orders as received from me to
your buyer. The bank will then telephone me the
deliveries of the stock, and I will telephone you to pay
over each cheque myself.</p>

<p>“The thing is to be reversed in sales, when you have
received certified cheques to your name as trustee,
for any sales, you are then to telephone down your
delivery order to be confirmed by me, after you have
brought me the cheques. I have a private wire to the
cashier, remember.</p>

<p>“But, above all, silence. You are now suspected of
being a daring and a lucky speculator. You will be
watched.</p>

<p>“Therefore, go out everywhere in society during
the next three weeks. Show yourself as gay and jolly
as you can.</p>

<p>“I am also handling some other very heavy matters,
and I wish you, just now, to be particularly thought
the gayest reveler in Gotham.</p>

<p>“In exhibiting yourself everywhere, the gossips will
cease to watch us jointly and our different purposes
will be divided in the public eye.</p>

<p>“Miss Kelly’s record of each day’s transactions will
be your warrant. She comes to me nightly to report.”</p>

<p>Vreeland was overjoyed as he received Mrs. Willoughby’s
hearty approval of his employing a personal
stenographer.</p>

<p>“If you get the right person,” said his patroness,
“she may be a pleasant companion for my trusted little
Mary.”</p>

<p>When he had raised the lady’s hand to his lips and
departed he realized how sternly he was being kept out
<a id="png.156" href="#png.156"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>154<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>of her real councils. Even the vainest fool could not
have deceived himself.</p>

<p>“It’s the payment of money, the changing of coin
between us, that simply makes me only an upper
servant,” he snarled.</p>

<p>“Once that money passes between man and woman,
in any relation, there is an end of any free will. But,
I can wait. And, you shall pay me, Madame, to the
uttermost, when you are in my power.”</p>

<p>He knew the probable magnitude of the transactions
and, even his iron nerve was shaken.</p>

<p>“It cannot be merely herself, it is the grouped official
cowards behind her, who are making money on the
sly.”</p>

<p>He found a new surprise awaiting him at his rooms,
one which brought the blood to his heart with a sudden
surge. There was a bunch of red roses awaiting
him with a sealed note. He knew not the handwriting,
but, his eyes gleamed with a strange fire as he read:</p>

<p>“The Lady of the Red Rose will visit you at ten
to-morrow night. Remember your promise. <em>Fail not.</em>
She will be veiled and dressed in black. <em>Be alone.</em>
And, at your door, <em>at ten</em>.”</p>

<p>“They are all the same,” he gasped, with a wildly
beating heart, “under the rose, lurks always some wild
intrigue, some desperate game.</p>

<p>“Life in New York is only a game of catch who
catch can.”</p>

<p>And, when the sunset of the next day came, Mr. Harold Vreeland had dispatched the acute Bagley to
Boston with a “valuable package” to be deposited in a
Safe Deposit Company there, and he was seated in his
own room gazing tenderly upon the crimsoned flowers
whose mute incense filled the air.</p>

<p><a id="png.157" href="#png.157"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>155<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The crawling hands of the clock were a torture to
the man whose darkest purpose was now hidden
behind a smiling face—for it is not often given, even
to a smooth scoundrel, to betray two women at once.
He was swimming in a sea of glory, now.</p>

<p>Vreeland slept but little after his conference with his
resolute and beautiful patroness. He had scanned her
face keenly to see the “sweet unrest of Love,” or the
play of a hidden passion written there, but all that the
keen schemer could discern was the calmness of a
settled purpose, the poise of an unshaken self-control.</p>

<p>“She has either no heart, or else, a marvelous power
of dissimulation,” he wearily decided. He felt that
she was playing some great hidden game in which he
was but a mere pawn, a poor private soldier in the fight.</p>

<p>“It’s a waiting game,” he rightly concluded, “but, it
is for vengeance, or a fight to cover up her clouded
past.”</p>

<p>He knew now that Elaine Willoughby was victorious
over her young social enemy at every point of the field.
For, the house of Hathorn was known to be divided
against itself, and the once magnificent Frederick’s
careworn brow showed a sullen discontent.</p>

<p>Hathorn’s disgruntled face was now too often
reflected in the mirrors of the Café Savarin bar; he
was shunned at the clubs even by the young <i lang="fr">flâneurs<!-- TN: original reads "flaneurs" --></i>
who had now gone over bodily to Mrs. Willoughby,
and the little Sunday afternoon <i lang="fr">séances</i> at Mrs. Alida
Hathorn’s became noted for their daring <i lang="fr">camaraderie</i>
and the “high class vaudeville” enacted there.</p>

<p>Hathorn was now more frequently absent from town
“upon business,” and Vreeland wrongly suspected
him of tracing down the past antecedents of “his
dearest foe.”</p>

<p><a id="png.158" href="#png.158"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>156<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“What the old Harry did she throw him over and
pick me up for?” he vainly pondered. “She may
have found him creeping too closely on her track and
perhaps she feared him.</p>

<p>“To cut the cord, she has pushed him out, and,
pensioned him off on Alida.</p>

<p>“But, what chilling spectre of the past affrights her?
That I can only reach by tapping her secret lines.</p>

<p>“I must get in between Endicott and her. I must
find out her relations with the Sugar Trust, and also
get at the underground railroad to the chamber
where the first news of the secret operations of the
‘Senate Finance Committee’ makes her the witch of
the Street.</p>

<p>“She is a sly one. She may be trading coldly on
the secrets of the Sugar magnates, possibly selling
out her senatorial friends and betraying old Endicott’s
banking connections.</p>

<p>“Her social entertainments, those little confidences
of the ‘pearl boudoir,’ give her a safe chance to play
these men off, the one against the other.”</p>

<p>Vreeland’s San Francisco experience, his analytical
brain, and his quick wit, had enabled him in his
few months of New York stock speculating, to
quietly pick up every trick of the “put, call and
straddle,” every dark cross of the bucket-shop infamy,
every “dummy” subterfuge used in “shearing the
sheep.”</p>

<p>He knew now every mystery of “doubled trades,”
“crossing trades,” and “wiping out a margin.”</p>

<p>“She has evidently never trusted me for a single
moment, and, has covered her right hand, while she
has played me as a ‘left bower.’”</p>

<p>It dawned upon him that she perhaps, like David,
<a id="png.159" href="#png.159"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>157<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>said in her heart, “All men are liars.” That her
“developing process” with Fred Hathorn had made
her “sadly wise,” and that she was “trying him out”
now at every distance, before making him a champion.</p>

<p>He had, however, preserved the same even, devoted
watchful courtesy, and he was wise enough not to try
to jump blindly from “seed time” to harvest. “She
has not opened her heart to me; if she ever marries
me, it will only be when she is driven to my arms.</p>

<p>“But, I can wait.”</p>

<p>And, so, never having dipped deeper into any true
woman’s heart than the light-winged swallow brushing
the lake, he forgot that he was not true to her.
He knew not the force of those ringing lines of “A
Fo’castle Ballad”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="qt">“If you’re good to her, she’s good to you!</div>
<div>For a woman’s square, if you treat her right!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The morning found the energetic Mr. Harold Vreeland
in close conference with the thin-lipped Miss
Marble, of “Marble’s Business Agency,” near that
dingy little square where Greeley in bronze gazes
vacantly down at his own feet, awed by the stony
glare of the New York Herald’s singularly inartistic
owls.</p>

<p>The wary woman broker had listened in silence to
the young banker’s long description of his need of an
accomplished “private secretary.”</p>

<p>She flushed slightly when Vreeland mentioned the
Elmleaf as the scene of the varied “labors.”</p>

<p>The quiet orgies of that “whited sepulchre” were
now the theme of much whispered comment over the
whole Tenderloin.</p>

<p>There were other “rising men” besides Harold
Vreeland burning the candle of Life at both ends there
<a id="png.160" href="#png.160"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>158<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and covertly reënacting the lurid scenes of old Monte
Tiberio, and infamous Baiæ.</p>

<p>“Expense is no object, my dear Miss Marble,” softly
purred Vreeland. “I fancy you know now what I
want. I would prefer a capable young woman who is
a stranger to New York City.</p>

<p>“One who has been accustomed to refinement. My
private correspondence is largely social.”</p>

<p>The handsome scoundrel’s eye sunk under the
keen woman’s direct thrust.</p>

<p>“There may be an objection on the part of the
young lady, your social surroundings are of the
gayest.”</p>

<p>Miss Marble was already familiar through the
“blanket sheets,” with the comet-like cavorting of
the young Western star in these Eastern skies.</p>

<p>“There is a business secretary, always there on
duty, an exemplary young woman now in my employ,
so, you can dismiss all your fears,” insidiously
remarked Vreeland, “and, for the right person, I will
pay you any commission that you ask.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the two adroit schemers met.</p>

<p>“I want a woman whom I can train up into my own
ways,” meaningly said Vreeland. “I think that you
understand me, now.”</p>

<p>The pale-green eyes of Miss Marble shone with glee
at the prospect of some other woman “with reluctant
feet” going blindly on to the thirty-third degree initiation
of the hard ways of New York.</p>

<p>“I do, perfectly,” she replied, her thin, pitiless lips
pressed closely together.</p>

<p>“How shall I select the one who is best fitted to suit
you?” Her voice was slightly shaky.</p>

<p>“Easy enough,” lightly cried Vreeland, reaching for
<a id="png.161" href="#png.161"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>159<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>his hat and cane. “Take two or three days. Go over
the whole field of your most promising applicants.
Have say, four or five of them here to meet me when
you are ready.</p>

<p>“You can indicate the one whom you would prefer.
Find out all their private histories, as far as you can get
at it,” he uneasily laughed.</p>

<p>“I will call in, of course, by hazard, and then take a
look at them. You can then have the one whom we
decide upon, meet me as your only candidate. The
rest you can leave to me. If the first one is not suitable,
we will follow on down the list.</p>

<p>“Remember, salary is no object. I am liberal in all
things, especially, as to your commission.”</p>

<p>For once in her artful career, Miss Joanna Marble
infused a real warmth into the clasp of her clammy
hand.</p>

<p>For these two read between the lines of each other’s
impassive faces.</p>

<p>“A very fine man—the sort of man likely in time, to
get shot or lynched, down South,” mused the veteran
Miss Marble, “as near a sleek human wolf in sheep’s
clothing as they put them up.”</p>

<p>And, then, Joanna Marble carefully indited a dragnet
advertisement which next day brought a shoal
of young womanhood to the breakers of her woman
trap.</p>

<p>There was “the solemn silence of the night,” the
“speaking silence of a dream,” at ten o’clock, as the
waiting Harold Vreeland listened with a beating heart
behind the portals of his aerial den in the Elmleaf.</p>

<p>That gliding step came at last. “Soft as the dews
that fell that night,” was the footfall of the Lady of
the Red Rose when <i lang="fr">très discretement vêtue</i>, in shrouding
<a id="png.162" href="#png.162"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>160<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>black, with her face swathed in an impermeable veil,
Alida Hathorn glided into his room, and coolly threw
aside her hat and wraps.</p>

<p>The flowers and ornate wealth of decorations made
the room a very dream of luxury. Vreeland sprang
forward when he had locked the door, but the burning
words of tenderness on his lips were stayed as a slender,
uplifted arm stopped him. The visitor’s face was
impassive.</p>

<p>“Not yet. We must understand each other,” was
the whisper which sounded like the voice of a lost soul.
It was, with a fatal overreaching, that Vreeland murmured,
“This is hardly the place for a business
interview.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” stolidly said Alida Hathorn, turning toward
him a face whose burning eyes thrilled him to his
bosom’s core. “You have as much to lose as I have,
perhaps more.”</p>

<p>“My life is ruined,” she gloomily said. “We will
play fair to-night, you and I, with the cards on top
the table. I know all your game—you shall now know
mine. And, I presume that both of us are willing to
pay the price.”</p>

<p>A French clock ticked away in the awkward silence,
and then, Vreeland, a master of woman’s moods,
quietly seated himself beside the excited woman, and
took her burning palms in his own.</p>

<p>“Tell me what your will is. It shall be my law,” he
simply said.</p>

<p>Alida Hathorn coldly studied his face for a moment.
“I will soon test your sincerity,” she answered. “I will
tear off the lying mask we all wear for a moment, and
let you see the real woman behind the society veneer.”</p>

<p>“I have found out that my husband is only a
<a id="png.163" href="#png.163"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>161<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>reckless stock gambler, a man who coldly married me
simply as ‘means to an end.’ He is half crazed by his
loss of influence in the Street.</p>

<p>“He has lately established secret branches of his
house in Buffalo, Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago
and Montreal.</p>

<p>“There seems to have been some devil crossing him
everywhere, and, he has also fought out a silent duel
to the death with Elaine Willoughby, who has torn
the old firm to pieces.”</p>

<p>Vreeland was now watching her with gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>“Wolfe has nothing whatever to lose. My husband
insists that I shall back the firm (practically himself),
and, he swears that you are the most successful man
on the Street. He knows of all your individual
plunging.</p>

<p>“And he knows, too, that you are ‘on the inside’
of the great Sugar deals, the Oil Company’s intrigues,
and, are first favorite now since Hathorn married.”</p>

<p>Her voice rang out bitterly as she buried her face in
her hands. “A woman’s capacity of resistance has its
limits.</p>

<p>“I come to you to-night for help. I will make one
last effort to break him of his mad folly, or else, leave
him to his fate.</p>

<p>“When he is penniless, he may follow me over to
Europe. He, at least, will be a husband, in name; a
protection against the foreign society mob, over there.”
Her voice was bitterly hard.</p>

<p>Vreeland began to murmur platitudes.</p>

<p>The beautiful woman’s eyes flashed. “Don’t dissemble.
You shall know what I want!” she cried,
pacing the room in her rising agitation.</p>

<p>“There is an ominous look in the Sugar market. You
<a id="png.164" href="#png.164"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>162<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>will go into the deal on a sure basis. Open your heart
to me to-night, for my own sake. Give me your game
for the next week. Let me copy it. I will make just
one turn for him. If you only play fair, I may save
him. It may bring me peace.</p>

<p>“If Hathorn will not be ruled, then my future life
will be my own. I depend on you—on your honor, on
your pledges made to me, at the Waldorf and the
Savoy. I have come to you, here, fearlessly. What
is your answer?”</p>

<p>They were facing each other, as Vreeland hoarsely
whispered, “And, my reward?” The woman’s warring
soul shone in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Let me know first that I can trust you,” she whispered
with ashen lips. “Trust to me, and, remember
a woman’s gratitude can overpay. Drive no hard
bargain with me.”</p>

<p>In a moment, Harold Vreeland, on his pinnacle of
sudden prosperity, saw the gulf yawning before him.
“If Elaine should find it out.” He bowed his head,
but the truth stole into his lying face.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that you are a coward?” cried Alida
Hathorn. “You would flinch before the woman who
has come to you here—<em>here</em>, at your bidding. I believed
that we both were ready to pay the price.” He sprang
to her side, in answer to the invitation of her eyes.</p>

<p>“Listen,” he whispered. “I will, so help me God,
give you all the duplicate orders of my private account
for the next two weeks. But, to you, alone.”</p>

<p>He listened, and was astounded at her daring plan to
receive his betrayal of the confidence of a woman who
had been her bane, and yet, he yielded to the charm
at last.</p>

<p>The echo of her departing foot on the stair left him
<a id="png.165" href="#png.165"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>163<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>stunned and breathless at his own unwitting self-surrender.
For, caught off his guard, he had left the
vantage-ground which he proposed to hold.</p>

<p>“In any case, neither of us will dare to speak.
There is ruin staring us both in the face, and, we
should play fair. Fear is a wise counselor,” she had
frankly said. He trembled before her moonlight eyes,
burning in a wild unrest.</p>

<p>She had dominated him at the last, and, swept away
an unscarred victor.</p>

<p>Three days of wild excitement followed the nocturnal
visit of the Lady of the Red Rose. Vreeland was
unable to leave his apartment even for a moment to
meet Justine, his busy spy, or to respond to the urgent
invitation of Miss Joanna Marble, who had telegraphed
to him: “I have found the very woman you want. A
perfect stranger, and, a beauty.”</p>

<p>In the haste of his feverish stock gambling, he had
only time to order this happily discovered nonpareil to
await his pleasure.</p>

<p>“Keep her with you. Give her a month’s salary, in
advance. Accept my check sent by messenger as
your commission. Will call soon.” So he had telegraphed
in reply to the adroit Miss Marble, and
dashed off a check for a round sum—a sum which
clearly indicated to the overjoyed Miss Marble, the
nature of the “discretionary advice” which she was to
give to the beautiful neophyte in New York’s fiercest
glitter.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland, with a pale face, sat on watch in
his own room, his eyes glued upon the features of
Mary Kelly as she recorded each momentous message
from the strange woman at the Circassia who was now
playing a gigantic game.</p>

<p><a id="png.166" href="#png.166"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>164<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>An influx of bank and stock private confidential
messengers, the evening conferences with Elaine Willoughby,
and a breathless study of check book stubs
“delivery and statements,” pressed him, while the
pale-faced woman near him, cut out every lurid article
of the daily journals describing the cyclonic rise and
fall of the price of Sugar Certificates now heaving in
a storm of unrest as sweeping as the Bay of Fundy’s
tides.</p>

<p>Below, in the noisy street, the newsboys bawled
“extras,” while all the hotels, clubs and money marts
were thronged with excited babblers.</p>

<p>For three days, the corridors of the New York Stock
Exchange were crowded with men whose vulpine
faces were either hardened by despair, or else excitedly
gleaming with the flush of victory.</p>

<p>Broad and Wall streets were filled with excited
crowds, while in the galleries, the clients, reporters
and money-betting public watched the members on the
floor struggling over Sugar.</p>

<p>From ten to three daily the heat of battle was on,
and, even after dark the duels of winner and loser
were transferred “uptown.”</p>

<p>In the Consolidated Petroleum and Stock Exchange
a mad riot reigned, intensified by the vociferous
dealings of the crowding “curb-stone” brokers.</p>

<p>With a cowardice newly born of his mean treason,
Harold Vreeland trembled as he crept out of the
“Elmleaf,” during the three days to steal into a
decorous-looking private residence near, where from
ten to three with her eyes glittering with a fierce
excitement, Alida Hathorn sat in a rear parlor, guarded
by the all too accommodating Mrs. Volney McMorris
cozily ensconced<!-- TN: original reads "esconced" --> upstairs.</p>

<p><a id="png.167" href="#png.167"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>165<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>But the schemer well knew that Hathorn was a leading
figure in the downtown mêlée where “Sugar” had
been steadily hammered down from “seventy” to
“fifty” under tremendous sales. Every conceivable
disaster had been suddenly “materialized” around the
standard of the hitherto strongly upheld monopoly.</p>

<p>It was on Friday, at one o’clock, that Vreeland, awestruck,
added up his scheduled statement of sales, on
ten-day delivery terms. It amounted to nearly twenty
thousand shares, and the total of the transactions
astounded him.</p>

<p>He had just stolen in to report the last order to
Alida Hathorn, a sale of a thousand shares, and she
had gleefully whispered, “You have already handled
twenty, but I have turned forty thousand shares, and
I’ve now reached my limit. If it goes down ten dollars
more, we can cover all our contracts and clear nearly
a half million dollars.”</p>

<p>Vreeland’s eyes opened in wonder, as he saw the
file of waiting messengers in her gallery, and a cipher
book at her side. He fled away in silence.</p>

<p>At the door of his room, he was seized by Mary
Kelly, her white hands trembling. “She is there
now at the instrument, calling you—hasten.”</p>

<p>Bold, intrigant, as he was, Vreeland paled, and the
blood left his heart as he listened to Elaine Willoughby’s
last orders. It was a most momentous message.
“Telegraph instantly down over private wire,
to Cashier Mineralogical Bank. For my order, <em>buy in</em>,
at once—on this board—forty thousand shares of Sugar
in lots of one to five thousand shares. Do not leave
the instrument for one moment, till you report the
execution back to me. Have them telegraph to you
the buying rate of each lot and report when all is
<a id="png.168" href="#png.168"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>166<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bought in. Then I will come to the Waldorf and send
over for you.</p>

<p>“I will sign the checks myself there at the hotel.
Keep the messengers there in your room with the
stocks. I have suite No. 700 in the hotel.”</p>

<p>Mary Kelly’s flying fingers had recorded the
momentous message in shorthand as it fell from
Hathorn’s pallid lips, and, her fingers then pressed the
telegraph key with lightning rapidity. Vreeland was
dazed. “My God, this is ruin for her,” he whispered.
It was of the Lady of the Red Rose he spoke.</p>

<p>“You must sit here, sir, and record for me,” cried
the girl. “They are holding me on the wire.” The
agony of hell was in the heart of the entrapped scoundrel.</p>

<p>He knew that his whole personal future now
depended on executing his mistress’ behests with lightning
rapidity. There was no way to warn Alida Hathorn.
He dared not trust Bagley—a spy, perhaps.</p>

<p>One hasty sentence of explanation and he sat down
at the table, beside the girl, while far away at the
Circassia, Elaine Willoughby eagerly awaited the
warning ring of the telephone bell. In three-quarters
of an hour, Vreeland staggered to the speaking tube.
“The whole order is covered,” he reported, “opening
price, forty-nine; closing price, seventy-three. I will
await you here.”</p>

<p>With a sickening heart, the would-be traitor watched
Mary Kelly adding up the scheduled lots and averaging
the prices.</p>

<p>“The whole forty thousand shares average us
sixty-four dollars,” she whispered, pushing the paper
over to him, as she bent over her clicking key.
“There has been a terrific rise. Failures on the
<a id="png.169" href="#png.169"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>167<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Street are reported. Sugar is going up with jumps.
Market practically bare.”</p>

<p>“My God!” groaned Vreeland, as he hid his face
for a few moments in his own room.</p>

<p>“This will be her ruin. Poor Alida. Forty thousand
shares left to cover, means a loss of three-quarters
of a million.”</p>

<p>And then his own white face stared back at him, in
the glass as his trembling lips refused to frame the
question: “Did Elaine know of his treachery?” For,
it seemed that his sin had found him out.</p>

<p>He dared not even for a single moment leave the
presence of the girl who was now recording each
message from the cashier of the bank, announcing the
departure of the agents with each lot of the stocks as
bought in.</p>

<p>“Was it a blind pool to break and make a market?”
he queried.</p>

<p>But, he found no time to steal away an instant from
Mary Kelly’s eyes and the impassive Bagley who stood
waiting to conduct him to Mrs. Willoughby at the
Waldorf. “I am watched,” the cowed traitor muttered.</p>

<p>The house was dark where Alida Hathorn had
directed her secret campaign when Vreeland, under
Bagley’s escort, returned at midnight from the Waldorf.
Vreeland turned his eyes away in a sickening
dread.</p>

<p>The only remark made by the serene Queen of the
Street was a commendation of his promptness. She
was graciously cheerful. “The market turned upon
us so quickly, that not a moment was to be lost,”
placidly remarked Elaine Willoughby, whose pleasant
smile of dismissal followed the sending up of a card
whereon Vreeland saw the words “Hiram Endicott.”
<a id="png.170" href="#png.170"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>168<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>But, his patroness said, “You have earned a week’s rest.
I can now give you that. You can amuse yourself
for a week. I shall stand out of the market. You
can go ahead and pick up the threads of current affairs
down town.</p>

<p>“Remember, not a word of this to Wyman. It
would lead to our instant parting. You have done
well. I know now that I can trust to you, to the very
last.”</p>

<p>Vreeland shuddered and stole away, wearing a sickly
smile. The night had new terrors for him now.</p>

<p>All that long night, Mr. Harold Vreeland paced his
room, waiting for the morrow. His haggard face
was gray and ashen in the morning dawn, as he waited
for the earliest journals.</p>

<p>And, for once, the brandy bottle was his friend.</p>

<p>He recalled a thousand times the impassioned face
of the beautiful woman who had blindly followed his
desperate lead.</p>

<p>“I had nothing to lose,” he mused. “This fierce play
was only a flurry to my nerves, but, she may be
wrecked. And if she should now turn upon me.”</p>

<p>He did not dare to think of facing her, and he even
feared to show himself in Wall Street until the news of
his beautiful accomplice’s situation should reach him.</p>

<p>“Where would she land on Life’s stormy seas?” He
did not dare to face the ruin he had wrought.</p>

<p>An occupation for his morning hours suggested itself.
He would visit Miss Joanna Marble, and so, at eleven
o’clock, he was seated in her “Bureau,” curiously
awaiting the arrival of the young woman who was to
fill the lofty position of “private secretary” to the
“star” of the Elmleaf. Leaning out of the window,
he beckoned to one of a shouting mob of newsboys as
<a id="png.171" href="#png.171"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>169<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the words “Extra! extra! Failures in Wall Street!”
resounded high above the din of Herald Square.</p>

<p>Tossing the lad a half dollar, he unfolded the still
damp sheet. Among the glaring headlines, he read,
“Failure of Hathorn &amp; Wolfe. Liabilities, one million
dollars.”</p>

<p>He sank back in his chair, and then, seized with a
sudden impulse, he quickly ran downstairs and jumped
into a coupé, bidding the agent detain the expected
beauty.</p>

<p>Some indefinable impulse led him to his rooms,
where the grave Bagley handed him a telegraphic dispatch.
He tore it open and read the bitter lines:
“You have lied and basely betrayed me. I have left
America forever. I leave it to the future to punish
you.” The signature, “Red Rose,” was that of a
woman who was sobbing alone in her stateroom on
the Etruria, as she glided past the Narrows on this
sunny Saturday morning.</p>

<p>With a clouded brow, Vreeland descended the stair
and at the street door, met Mr. Jimmy Potter, who
whispered: “Fred Hathorn has cleared out to Havana—last
night—the fool. He gouged his wife out of half
a million.</p>

<p>“I saw her off on the Etruria to-day, and I’m going
to save what I can for her out of the wreck, and,
then go over and meet her in Paris.</p>

<p>“I told you that all things would come round to the
man who waits.”</p>

<p>With a smothered oath, Vreeland pushed on, glad to
escape the easy-going tormentor who was destined to
be the <i lang="fr">prochain ami</i> of the daring Lady of the Red
Rose.</p>

<p>He dashed away to Miss Marble’s “Bureau,” where
<a id="png.172" href="#png.172"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>170<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>his eyes gleamed as Miss Joanna led him into her
private room. Her warning glance gave him the key
to his conduct.</p>

<p>And he was speechless in silent rapture, as he gazed
upon the fresh and womanly beauty of “Miss Romaine
Garland, stenographer.”</p>

<p>“She is the very woman,” he mused. “The woman
of my dreams.”</p>

<p>Afar, uptown, in the shaded boudoir of her pleasaunce
palace, Elaine Willoughby dropped the newspaper from
her hands. “I am safe at last. He is a criminal fugitive.</p>

<p>“And, now, to plead to God for the return of my
child.”</p>

<p class="chaphead">SENATOR ALYNTON’S COLLEAGUE.</p>


<p>An exciting month had slipped away after the sudden
Sugar flurry in Wall Street which had filled
its gray granite channels with lame and dead ducks.</p>

<p>Seated in his cozy morning room at the “Elmleaf,”
Mr. Harold Vreeland was reflectively watching the
snowflakes whirled by a March storm in fluffy white
eddies, and furtively gazing askance upon the beautiful
face of Romaine Garland at his side.</p>

<p>“Where have I seen that face before?” he mused, as
the lovely stenographer arose with a silent bow, and
passed through the half-open door to seat herself at
her typewriting table, <i lang="fr">en vis-à-vis</i> with Mary Kelly
nodding over her clicking telegraph instrument.</p>

<p>There was ample time for Vreeland to attend to his
growing personal correspondence in these long mornings
when he awaited the next secret orders of his patroness.
But, a singular social and speculative lethargy
now seemed to have seized upon Mrs. Elaine Willoughby.
The nearness of Lent, the reaction of the
giddy winter social season, and the cares of a large
property all contributed to keep the woman who had
fought Alida Hathorn to a finish, out of the garish
glare of show society.</p>

<p>All the news that Vreeland could gain from the
watchful Doctor Alberg and the pliant Justine was,
that the Lady of Lakemere was seemingly drifting
into a settled melancholy. Vreeland was astonished
at the dead water into which he himself had glided.
<a id="png.174" href="#png.174"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>172<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>His afternoons were regularly spent now at the Wall
Street office, where Wyman was busied with the
“legitimate.”</p>

<p>It had been Vreeland’s secret self-appointed task to
follow out all the details of the Hathorn &amp; Wolfe
failure, whose echoes still reverberated in the curses
of the defrauded customers.</p>

<p>Wolfe was left alone to face the music, and the whole
financial world knew that the great sums paid in to the
firm’s coffers by customers in the sudden Sugar flurry
had been all diverted by the fugitive Hathorn to margin
those enormous private deals of his own plunging,
which, even criminal in their character, had been
made dead against the rising market. The “double
or quits” had been “quits” with him. His disgraced
name was off the club lists, the VanSittart town mansion
was closed, the deserted Oakwood place was
garrisoned for a long foreign stay of the unhappy
heiress, and “lightly they spoke of the spirit” which
had fled with Hathorn’s good luck.</p>

<p>There was little left for the plundered creditors to
divide but “experience.”</p>

<p>Wolfe, the luckless partner, was sullen and crushed,
and a new champion, Mr. James Potter, alertly moved
around town gathering up loose ends in the interest of
the absent wife.</p>

<p>Wyman, beyond a cold comment that Hathorn’s
“pace had been a killing one,” never referred to the
utter crash of their natural enemies, and the social
world was beginning to forget Mr. Frederick Hathorn,
having relegated him to the “Limbo” of failure, and
marked him off as a “has been.” The mad rush of
New York life soon tramples the forgotten graves to a
dead level.</p>

<p><a id="png.175" href="#png.175"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>173<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>In the avoidance of any question as to his regular
morning absence, Vreeland knew that Wyman had
been evidently posted by Judge Endicott as to Vreeland’s
sidereal duties under the orders of Mrs. Willoughby.</p>

<p>It was wormwood to the man who still aspired to
read every hidden secret of Elaine Willoughby’s life to
know that Wyman and Endicott now frequently
spent the long evenings with the Queen of the Street
at the “Circassia,” and that vouchers, schedules and
papers covered the great table where only the three
sat, well out of reach of Justine’s eaves-dropping.</p>

<p>“Cool old file is Endicott,” growled Vreeland.
“Cased in steel armor of proof. Nor passion, pride,
nor weakness ever leaves him open to the enemy a
moment.”</p>

<p>And then his habitual sneer returned. “Bah! He
is too old for all of man’s follies. It is only the
young and ardent who burn with fond hopes and
bravely take the chances of life in the open.</p>

<p>“He has nothing left to gain, why should he disquiet
himself? Man delights him not, no—nor woman
either.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Elaine Willoughby had really overplayed
the game of an assumed carelessness as to Hathorn’s
fate. Vreeland was not deceived.</p>

<p>He narrowly watched her when he ventured to call
and report the aftermath of the Hathorn failure. Her
lack of interest in the downfall of the two whom she
had fought in society and on the Street was entirely
forced. She gloated over her victory.</p>

<p>Her despondency, however, was real, for a vague
sorrow shone in her eyes and the great rooms of the
Circassia were no longer filled with that glittering
<a id="png.176" href="#png.176"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>174<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>throng which she had drawn away from Alida Hathorn’s
Fifth Avenue drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>“Did she ever love Hathorn?” was Vreeland’s self-torturing
question. “And is her vengeance after all
only Dead Sea fruit?” He secretly resented the calm,
equable kindness of his patroness, for there was no
answering glow within her splendid eyes, no quickening
of her frozen pulses at his approach.</p>

<p>“She has only used me as a human buffer, a switch
to safely reach the other track, and I have worked
under the espionage of the adroit Mary Kelly. I see
her whole plan,” wrathfully decided Vreeland.</p>

<p>“To break up her whole secret into disjointed links.
To play us off, one against the other, and then perhaps
to drop me, forever, as she dropped Hathorn, if I
am ever caught napping.</p>

<p>“She guards some momentous secret. Either of this
hidden syndicate’s inside methods, or else the dangerous
past life which blackens her present. How much
of that did Hathorn know?</p>

<p>“Not enough to hurt her. But, I will rule her by
fear yet, for love is out of the game. Let me secretly
tap her lines, and, then, <i lang="fr">gare le corbeau</i>!”</p>

<p>He had once timidly approached Mrs. Willoughby as
to the immediate-future programme of the uptown
“special bureau.” His patroness manifested but little
interest and simply coldly said, “You will have ample
leisure for society and your own affairs. Remain
there silent, watchful, and always on duty, though.</p>

<p>“The reincorporation in New Jersey, the coming
division into common and preferred stock, and the
court’s dubious actions may cause me to act strongly
in simulated attack or defense, at any moment. And
there’s always that veering Congress; its actions are
<a id="png.177" href="#png.177"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>175<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>inexplicably swayed under flex or reflex of the public
mind, private manipulation or ‘advanced journalism.’”<!-- TN: original reads "advanced journalism." -->
Vreeland chafed in his heart that there had been as
yet no <i lang="fr">rapprochement</i> between himself and Senator
Alynton. A slight cold disdain seemed to chill that
magnate’s courtesy in all their brief <i lang="fr">rencontres</i>. “He
likes me not!” was the schemer’s just observation.
And yet, he gravely held a uniform courtesy.</p>

<p>A special delivery letter at last awoke Vreeland from
his reverie, as he was furtively gazing at Miss Romaine
Garland’s shapely head bowed over her machine, and
then the tube’s whistle announced from below a call of
“Mr. James Potter” on “the most important business.”</p>

<p>The letter lay unopened as Vreeland wonderingly
advanced to meet his unfrequent visitor.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that the “butterfly” of fashion
was gravely impressed. It was none of the Dickie
Doubleday’s crumpled rose leaves which had brought
the pale-faced man to the luxurious sky parlors of the
“Elmleaf.” His merry face was soberly overshadowed.</p>

<p>With little formality, Jimmy Potter closed the door
into the rooms where the two women were engaged,
and, not without a glance of impelled admiration at the
statuesque stenographer, broke into a confidence which
astounded Vreeland.</p>

<p>“Hear me out first, Vreeland,” he soberly said,
“and then help me if you can. I’m off on the steamer
for Havre to-morrow. To join Hathorn’s widow.”</p>

<p>Vreeland started, but Potter’s outstretched arm kept
him in his chair.</p>

<p>“Poor Fred was drowned two days ago by the
upsetting of a boat at Cienfuegos. The fact is, the
Cuban authorities were after him, and so, he cleared
out of Havana.”</p>

<p><a id="png.178" href="#png.178"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>176<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I’ve sent a good man down there to do all that may
be done, in a decent respect for his past. Mrs. Hathorn
has just cabled for me. I have had a long letter
from her.</p>

<p>“Some damned traitor deliberately gave her the
dead cross on the ‘Sugar Deal.’ She was trying to
get Fred out of the Street. And so, she plunged on
fifty thousand shares of Sugar on this lying tip, came
out short, and has to pay, as Hathorn shoved all their
customers’ money in to hold over his own huge, private
gamble until the market broke down to forty.
It’s up to seventy-eight and there to stay. Now, she
wishes to make restitution to the men whom the firm
robbed. And I have to help her settle her own
private losses.”</p>

<p>“Poor woman,” murmured Vreeland, with an agitation
which did not escape Potter. The little man was
all broken up.</p>

<p>“See here, Vreeland!” cried Potter, “I have had a
glimpse into a real woman’s heart. This fatal quarrel
with the Willoughby has wrecked two lives. Hathorn
believed Mrs. Willoughby to be invincible in the Street.</p>

<p>“He tried to follow her game. She is reported to
have dealt in Sugar up to several millions.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that she laid a trap for Hathorn’s
wife to fall into? Who gave her the false tips? I
hope that the author of this misery will roast in hell.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing. I am not in speculative stocks,”
musingly said Vreeland.</p>

<p>“Someone may have taken advantage of the Hathorns
and lured them on by pretending to give them
Mrs. Willoughby’s game. I am busied here now, half
the day, with my own private matters.”</p>

<p>“It was soul-murder, whoever did it,” said Potter.
<a id="png.179" href="#png.179"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>177<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“Alida Hathorn went in nobly to help and save her
husband. To aid him, to square him with the Street
and his firm, and then to take him forever out of the
turmoil and convoy him over to Europe. She has
loads of money, you know. But, the Ring was too
much for him.</p>

<p>“He plunged, too, on her tip, and then came the
crash, his flight, and now his untimely death. It’s all
due to the one who lured Alida Hathorn on to ruin her
husband. It was a fiend’s work.” A silence reigned,
a gloomy acquiescence.</p>

<p>Vreeland was moodily regarding the falling snow
through the darkened panes when Jimmy Potter sighed
and said: “Well, it’s good-by, old fellow. I’ve got an
expert with Wolfe going over the real honest debts.</p>

<p>“I shall stay over there, advise with Alida and see
that the sufferers get their money. For she has been
a wifely sacrifice; she is high-spirited and true, she
outclassed Hathorn. Mrs. Willoughby set him up,
and then threw him down.</p>

<p>“His pride never got over her ruin of his firm’s reputation
by drawing all her business out.</p>

<p>“Of course, the society snakes who poisoned the
young wife’s mind brought on the social catastrophe.
I would like to feel that Elaine Willoughby did not
betray that poor young woman. But I’ll square it all
by and by.”</p>

<p>“How?” eagerly demanded Vreeland. Potter was
brave in a mad resolve.</p>

<p>The young millionaire paused, hat and umbrella in
hand. “I have found a business in life at last. One
that suits me.</p>

<p>“If Alida Hathorn has not money enough to square
all the honest claims, <em>I have</em>. For a year and a day
<a id="png.180" href="#png.180"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>178<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>from Hathorn’s death, I shall marry her, and then
give her a woman’s decent happiness.</p>

<p>“It was a false ambition that pushed Hathorn into
her circle. He was only a good-looking upstart, and
never worthy of her.</p>

<p>“So, you can see all comes around to the man who
waits.</p>

<p>“Now, I count on your sense of manliness to protect
the name of Fred Hathorn’s widow, the woman who
will be my wife, for, with all your money, you would
not be in New York to-day, as you are, at the top of
the ladder but for Hathorn.</p>

<p>“You stand in his shoes up at Lakemere, here in
the Circassia, and you of all men, should be considerate
to his memory.” The scheming liar bowed his head
in a speechless agitation.</p>

<p>Vreeland escorted his visitor to the stair. “If I
need any private tip, I may use you,” said Potter. “I’ll
be at Hotel Vendôme, Paris, till I have made her Mrs. Jimmy Potter, if we live.”</p>

<p>With a last touch of his old lightness, the champion
of the absent Alida whispered, “That’s a young goddess
you have captured.” Potter had observed the
Bona Dea.</p>

<p>Vreeland frowned gravely as he followed the
furtive gesture.</p>

<p>“Miss Garland has entire charge of all the books
and records of my private estate,” he coldly said.</p>

<p>“I am a man of system and order. The other little
woman is my private telegraph operator. She is a part
of our ‘business force.’” Vreeland affected the careworn
millionaire.</p>

<p>“Ah, you don’t mix up the two affairs. Very good,
very good,” complacently said Potter as he disappeared,
<a id="png.181" href="#png.181"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>179<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>leaving Vreeland startled. He bore away fruitful
memories of Vreeland’s downcast hesitation.</p>

<p>The hard-hearted schemer took a pull at the brandy
bottle. “It was a close shave,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Alida Hathorn is game to the very last. She has
not given him my name, <!-- TN: stray single quotation mark removed -->and now, as she will finally
drift into this fortunate marriage, the Lady of the Red
Rose will be only a buried memory.</p>

<p>“I am safe, and he never will know. The lovely
‘Red Rose’ is only another flower in <i lang="fr">le Jardin Secret</i>.”</p>

<p>He realized, at last, that the daring imprudence of
Alida Hathorn’s visit was but a jealous wife’s device,
at any risk, to break the lines of her husband’s enemies.</p>

<p>“She got my secret far too easily,” he gloomily
reflected, “and without paying the price.</p>

<p>“I wonder if she was playing me as a lone fish,” he
pondered—and then a flash came to enlighten him.</p>

<p>“Could Elaine Willoughby fancy that the news of
her plunging would leak out and ruin them?</p>

<p>“By heaven! She may have crossed this gigantic
trade by secret orders to Endicott. Hathorn ruined,
she may have no further use for me.</p>

<p>“And if the Lady of the Red Rose should ever
speak I would be ruined, even held at arms length as I
am.”</p>

<p>He shuddered under the curse of the burning words
of that last telegram.</p>

<p>“She believes me a liar and traitor to her, and I
will never dare to undeceive her.” He felt that he had
missed the finest play of his life.</p>

<p>But the “special delivery” letter still stared him in
the face. He carelessly tore it open and then a smile
wreathed his lips.</p>

<p>“To meet Senator Alynton, Senator Garston, and
<a id="png.182" href="#png.182"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>180<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Miss Katharine VanDyke Norreys at dinner.” He
instantly wrote out and dispatched his acceptance. A
glow of joy lit up his anxious face.</p>

<p>“I must get Justine at work soon on my secret lines.
I see it all. These Senators are of the ‘Inner Guild,’
the true illuminati.</p>

<p>“Who the devil is this Garston—some Western fellow?”</p>

<p>A few moments’ reference gave him the news:
“Senator-elect from one of the newly knocked together
Western States”—the “means to an end” in balancing
National elections. The trick of warring plutocrats
and democrats.</p>

<p>He paced the room in deep thought, after dispatching
his reply. “The battle will be on again soon.
The Trust is reorganized and conveniently removed to
little Jersey. The courts have now done their worst,
and the small holders are all squeezed out.</p>

<p>“Now for a game of high ball. Yes, my lady, that’s
your trick. A new deal. And the beautiful Californian
heiress is only a bright lay-figure.</p>

<p>“Your real hold on the Street is the secret chain
linking these statesmen, through you and Endicott, to
the secret chiefs of the Sugar Syndicate.</p>

<p>“I’ll get myself into your current, as a ‘transmitter,’
and you, Madame Elaine, shall yet learn to bow and
bend. The child, the secrets of this dangerous partnership,
the story of your past life, I can soon get it all,
bit by bit. And, then, marriage and ‘dominion over
you.’ That’s my game!”</p>

<p>There was an unpleasant menace lingering in the last
words of the departing Potter. Vreeland knew that
should the generous-hearted ex-banker, in time, marry
Fred Hathorn’s widow, the few hundred thousands
<a id="png.183" href="#png.183"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>181<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>lost in saving Hathorn’s personal honor would not in
any way impair their united estates. He lingered long
on the subject. He feared this new alliance.</p>

<p>“They might crush me, if they joined forces. The
one danger is a reconciliation with Mrs. Willoughby.
I will see that this never occurs.”</p>

<p>And so, with a sense of defeat clinging to his past
attempts, he decided to use great care in approaching
his proposed dupe, Miss Romaine Garland.</p>

<p>For his patroness certainly was not wearing her
heart upon her sleeve now. Her private sorrows busied
her more than the confidential intimacy with her newest
<i lang="fr">protégé</i>.</p>

<p>“She could drop me, ruin me, or trap me as easily
as she finished off Hathorn,” he decided.</p>

<p>“And the hot-headed, daring young wife, desperate
in her jealousy, anxious to break Elaine Willoughby’s
lines and guide her husband into the heart of the
Sugar forces, she had merely broken the <i lang="fr">convenances</i>,
nothing more.</p>

<p>“For only a cur dare ever hint at the stolen visits.
Club and coterie would brand the man as a hound
who dared to boast of such a desperate confidence in a
man’s honor.</p>

<p>“No. The Lady of the Red Rose, bright, daring
and stormy-hearted like many another <i lang="fr">fin de siècle</i> New
York wife, was safe.”<!-- TN: closing quote invisible --></p>

<p>Safe by all the laws of manhood and honor. And,
in all the gay life he had led, he had only met the easy
abandon of high life.</p>

<p>The loosening of restraint of a democratic luxury.
He well knew that the Dickie Doubledays and the
Tottie Thistledowns did not weigh in the scale against
a real flesh and blood womanhood. They were only
<a id="png.184" href="#png.184"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>182<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bright, lurid beacons, warning signals on the seas of
life, stranded on the reefs of human weakness, and
with shoals of foolish virgins following on in their
daring footsteps.</p>

<p>When he lifted his head, the stroke of twelve brought
Miss Romaine Garland, with bowed head, before him,
awaiting her daily dismissal.</p>

<p>He had never dared to use the busy hours from nine
to twelve for any covert approach upon the stately
girl’s confidence. There, too, was the clear-eyed Mary
Kelly.</p>

<p>The rapturous verdict of Jimmy Potter was confirmed
as he glanced at the young goddess, her brown
hair rippling from a pure Greek brow, her dark eyes
dreaming under their lashes, and her pale, proud face
at rest, with all the untroubled peace of maidenhood.</p>

<p>In her plain, dark dress, her sculptured form was
deliciously intimated. Her voice, sweet and low as the
breath of forest winds, awoke his hungering curiosity.
It was <i lang="fr">temps de relâche</i>.</p>

<p>Here was the very chance to begin to mold her to
his will. To awake her latent love of luxury, to lead
her out step by step into the confidential delights of
wine and song, and to find out the shady places where
Love lurks, an archer unawares. Yes. He would
begin to mold this woman to his will.</p>

<p>Vreeland desired to let the loneliness of a great city
aid him in his easy approach. And to hurry slowly
and be wise. He had noted the friendly cordiality of
the two young women. “If the new assistant would
only play into his hands, and help to outwit the pale
spy.</p>

<p>“If she can throw this little spy off her guard—if
I can get them both to begin to enjoy themselves a
<a id="png.185" href="#png.185"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>183<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>little, and then drop into an easy, hidden intimacy
with Miss Romaine, then my patroness’ little spy game
here will be useless.</p>

<p>“For, if that woman learned to love a man, she
would go through fire and water for him.”</p>

<p>The throbbing of his heart made his voice tremble,
and the veiled purpose of his crafty soul crept into his
eyes, though they only rested on her superbly molded
arms and slender, delicate hands, when he carelessly
said: “If you would kindly leave me your private
address, Miss Garland, I might need it. There may
be some extra call of duty. I might wish to communicate
with you.”</p>

<p>There was a slight flush upon her cheek as the delicate
lips slowly parted.</p>

<p>“I live at some distance, Mr. Vreeland, with private
friends, and it would be impossible for me to render
you any other services than as arranged. I have no
one to escort me, and I never receive visitors.” The
voice was as cold as the glacier’s rills.</p>

<p>Her beauty shone out as pure as an Easter lily, when
she simply said: “Miss Kelly will, however, send any
communication you might have to make. I am an
absolute stranger in New York. The references which
I gave Miss Marble are from old friends in Buffalo.
I can, however, at all times, stay as late as Miss Kelly
does, on any occasion when you may have overwork.”</p>

<p>The young Diana’s pure brow was loftily brave in
its innocence.</p>

<p>Vreeland’s eyes hungrily followed her as she moved
quietly away in answer to his grave bow of dismissal.</p>

<p>“More time. More time,” he murmured. “If I
could find some way to gain her personal confidence.
Flowers, books, little attentions, a stray set of theatre
<a id="png.186" href="#png.186"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>184<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>or opera tickets. For she is, after all, only a woman.
Fit to reign, royal in youth, and serving without
stooping.</p>

<p>“I must see Miss Marble. The ice once broken,
<span class="nw">perhaps—”</span></p>

<p>He mused long upon an ingenious plan to “brighten
the life” of the woman he would use as a tool.
“Yes, it can be done, easily, through the Marble.”
And he knew that veteran traitress would aid him for
money.</p>

<p>The week before the day of Mrs. Willoughby’s ceremonial
dinner was wasted by Vreeland in some amateur
detective work. Miss Justine Duprez easily diagnosed
the growing friendship of the two young girls.</p>

<p>For Miss Garland’s sweet, tender face was already
familiar in the little household where Mary Kelly’s
mother watched and wondered from what fairyland
this bright-faced nymph had descended.</p>

<p>A stout school lad of sixteen was an efficient home
escort for the young neophyte in New York, and pride
filled the eyes of Mary Kelly’s brother.</p>

<p>Vreeland felt all the growing charm of the steadfast
girl’s influence, her cultured manners, her dainty
refinement and the rare delicacy of her language and
taste. He valued her as of superior clay.</p>

<p>“Not of common stock,” he murmured as he deftly
trod along her path, with a veiled impatience. He
was deep now in the last details of a plan which busied
Justine Duprez, for the coming of the second Senator,
the open splendors of the grand dinner party as elaborated
by Justine warned him that if he would cut the
secret channels so vital to his success, he must bring
the janitor and postal carriers of the “Circassia”
under control.</p>

<p><a id="png.187" href="#png.187"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>185<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Justine, checking his headlong impatience, only
smiled her velvety smile and whispered, “Give me
some money to hoodwink them a little. Wait only for
a few days, and trust to me. Have I ever failed you?”</p>

<p>When the “rising and successful man,” Mr. Harold
Vreeland, dressed himself with unusual distinction for
Mrs. Willoughby’s regal dinner party of twenty, there
was all the happiness of a new-born hope in his heart.
For he was nearly ready now “to move on the enemy’s
works.”</p>

<p>That experienced “broker in young womanly talent,”
Miss Marble, had earned herself a pretty diamond lace
pin, and “an authorization to proceed,” by her ingenious
plan of drawing out “Miss Romaine Garland.”
The experienced lady had smiled at all his first crude
attempts.</p>

<p>“You were too abrupt. There is the awkward fact
before her eyes always, that you are her employer.
She acts on the mere defensive.</p>

<p>“The proprieties you surely know. Now, you are
far too young and charming as a man,” she blushingly
said, “to be a safe benefactor for this glowing-hearted
girl with her sweet, tender eyes.</p>

<p>“She is a rare beauty and frankly good, and
untinged as yet with the fires of Babylon. I have some
showy friends of some influence, and, as she trusts me
blindly, I will ‘have warm-hearted civilities’ extended
to her.</p>

<p>“You will have her home address now, in return for
my pretty pin. Never go there. You would ruin all.</p>

<p>“But, sir, you shall be drawn in as a guest to our
little friendly coteries. She must be led into our allied
camp gradually.</p>

<p>“You, by hazard, will appear as an old intimate, here
<a id="png.188" href="#png.188"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>186<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and there, when her shyness is worn off and, on that
friendly and neutral ground, you can soon warm the
marble into life.” The Marble had a crafty and glowing
heart.</p>

<p>The sly woman smiled. “No lonely young woman
can resist long-continued and unobtrusive<!-- TN: original reads "unobstrusive" --> kindness.
It always disarms. Let me have the means to lead her
along into little pleasures. Once the taste of the easy
evening outing life comes upon her, then, bit by bit,
she will be as wax in my hands. You can meet her,
by chance, at the theatres or operas when out with
me. I will have a little supper given at some friend’s
home. We can drop off the friends one by one. I
cling to her.</p>

<p>“You can then drop me off, when we are sure that the
taste of pleasure is gently awakened, and you are free to
then show her all your generous liberality. Take her
home to your daily life, then once that the confidential
relation is established—” Vreeland’s eyes gleamed in a
coming triumph. The way shone out, “straight and
sweet,” before him. “<!-- TN: opening quote invisible -->Miss Joanna, you are a good fairy,
and a keen-witted genius. I will give you <i lang="fr">carte blanche</i>
to lead her out along the rosy path, step by step, and
a path that leads always toward me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Vreeland moved on serenely and laid his
pitfalls for the pure young girl, whom chance had
thrown in his way, with no compunction. In the
blighted career of his own dishonored father, he had
only despised the weaknesses which led to failure.</p>

<p>He had seen the downfall of Hathorn without a
throb of sympathy and he resented the frank, honest
predilection which was now leading the warm-hearted
Potter to screen Alida Hathorn from a mob of cold-hearted
“woman eaters” in honorable marriage.</p>

<p><a id="png.189" href="#png.189"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>187<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Mean at heart, he even doubted the past life of the
woman who had lifted him up to luxury. He hated
her now only that his charms of person and manner
had not brought her to his feet, a willing dupe.</p>

<p>“She seemed to be impressed at first,” he mused.
“But the shock of Hathorn’s cold abandonment in
his little tiger cat wife’s jealous frenzy seems to have
turned her against man, for a time.</p>

<p>“But, let me only get a hold on her. I do not care
to be the star actor in a modern ‘Romance of a Poor
Young Man.’ She shall not shake me off.”</p>

<p>He plotted deliberately against her peace—his generous
benefactress. “First, the tapping of the private
lines. Then, to mold Romaine Garland to my will. If
she does not yield to Joanna Marble’s smooth ways,
then out into the streets of New York.</p>

<p>“There are others, more complaisant; but to awaken
those dark eyes to pleasure’s glow. To have them
quicken at my coming.”</p>

<p>It was with these “undreamed dreams” haunting
him that Harold Vreeland arrived, in sedate splendor,
at the “Circassia,” where “the feast was set” for Senator
Alynton and that Western wonder of recent occultation,
Senator-elect James Garston.</p>

<p>In the kaleidoscopic splendors of the drawing-room,
where manly eyes gleamed upon the beauties of splendid
womanhood, among the fair daughters of Eve he
missed that brilliant blonde heiress, Miss Katharine
VanDyke Norreys. A tap from Mrs. Volney McMorris’
fan recalled him.</p>

<p>“I know that you are looking for her,” whispered
the radiant duenna. “Katharine is a sort of ward of
Senator Garston. He is her trustee. They all come
together. I must have a word with you about <span class="nw">poor—”</span></p>

<p><a id="png.190" href="#png.190"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>188<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The entrance of Mrs. Elaine Willoughby brought the
splendid circle around her, there where gleaming
lights and the breath of matchless flowers, where
diamonds and brightest eyes, where ivory bosoms and
shapely silver shoulders were mingling charms of a
modern Paradise of throbbing, hungry hearts.</p>

<p>Doctor Alberg’s gloved hand was resting in Vreeland’s
palm—he was whispering, “You and I and
Justine must watch”—when the calm, passionless face
of Senator Alynton, with Miss Katharine Norreys on
his arm, appeared.</p>

<p>There was a hum of astonishment, of frank self-surrender
to the Occidental beauty’s charms as Alynton
gravely presented a tall, stately stranger, whose
slightly silvered hair and chevalieresque bearing
recalled the “Silver King.”</p>

<p>“My friend, Senator James Garston,” began Alynton,
but there was a crowd of a dozen men eagerly
stretching willing arms, as Elaine Willoughby’s face
contracted in a spasm of pain, and she fell senseless
into Doctor Alberg’s firm grasp. “Only the old heart
trouble. In five minutes madame will be herself,”
suavely announced the doctor. “Perhaps a bit too
tightly laced,” he whispered to Mrs. McMorris.</p>

<p>It was a stately function, the dinner, which proceeded
in a solemn splendor.</p>

<p>Senator James Garston was gravely attentive at the
hostess’ left, and only Vreeland knew when the lights
were low that Garston had whispered, “I must see you,
at once.”</p>

<p>And with pale lips Elaine Willoughby had murmured,
“At Lakemere, and to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Justine had gained her long-needed clue.</p>

<h3 title="X. An interview at Lakemere"

 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p class="chaphead">AN INTERVIEW AT LAKEMERE—SOME INGENIOUS
MECHANISM.—“WHOSE PICTURE IS THAT?”</p>


<p>Harold Vreeland was seated in a blaze of light, in
his own rooms at four in the morning, anxiously awaiting
a night visit from one who might unravel the whole
mystery while the lonely Elaine Willoughby lay helpless
in her secluded rooms, feebly struggling toward a
return of her self-control.</p>

<p>“What new devil’s jugglery is this?” muttered Vreeland,
pausing in his wolf stride. He carefully recalled
every action of the newly-made Senator and yet he
was baffled at every turn. “Was the newcomer an
agent of a morose husband, an old lover, or an unwelcome
apparition from the clouded past?” He was
baffled.</p>

<p>For, he began to realize how baseless were his
meaner suspicions of the past. There had been no
unworthy love between Elaine and Hathorn. The
devil’s poison of slander alone had excited Alida’s
burning jealousy. She herself had only sought “a
dead straight point” in the daring visit to his rooms.
Elaine’s record was clear so far. “Was it only an old
sorrow?” He pondered long. Even the pale-faced,
proud girl, whom he would trap, so far had hugged
her honest poverty to a stainless bosom.</p>

<p>“I’ve been dead wrong on Alynton’s game all along.
There’s neither an old love, nor a new intrigue,
there,” he growled. “Justine has clearly proved that.
Their union is only to be termed, ‘strictly business.’</p>

<p><a id="png.192" href="#png.192"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>190<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“And the Senator’s frank, brotherly concern at
Elaine’s sudden illness went no farther than Colonel
Barton Grahame’s sympathy, Judge Endicott’s alarm,
or my own undisguised interest. Here is a new jack-in-the-box.
I must watch Senator Garston.”</p>

<p>It had been a galling mortification to Vreeland in
the past, that faintly disguised disdain of Senator David
Alynton, who had always practically ignored him.</p>

<p>But, this new statesman, sturdy James Garston, had
brought to their meeting an unfeigned western
<i lang="fr">bonhomie</i>.</p>

<p>The newcomer had sought him out eagerly. He had
drawn the younger man aside, in a lull of the entertainment.</p>

<p>“We must meet and talk over western matters; we
have the world’s coming treasury out there,” largely
remarked the new Senator-elect.</p>

<p>“I am housed at the Plaza, to be near Miss Norreys,
who is at the Savoy. I shall stay here a few days,
and, we will have a luncheon together.”</p>

<p>In fact the acute Mrs. Volney McMorris had very
deftly arranged it, for she was eager to matronize the
resplendent Miss Norreys, to bask in the smile of this
rising financial sun, and to have her own private chat
with the young Fortunatus about the vanished Lady
of the Red Rose. Her prompt social fastening upon
Mrs. Willoughby, was only a grim proof that “the
one who goes is happier than the one that’s left
behind.”</p>

<p>The new Senator’s round bullet-head, his curved
beak-like nose, his uncertain gray eye and unsmiling
lips marked him as a man of power.</p>

<p>He bore in every movement the badge of hard-won
success.</p>

<p><a id="png.193" href="#png.193"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>191<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>His fifty-one years had marked him lightly, and,
lawyer, mine owner, and capitalist, he was riding into
the Senate on a chariot with golden wheels. It is the
West that holds now the American sceptre.</p>

<p>Vreeland had watched Garston keenly at the dinner
and noted his poised manner, his brilliant flashes of
silence, and the grave, undisturbed courtesy of his
demeanor toward the marble-faced hostess. “A man
of a level head,” was Vreeland’s verdict. And he
tried to read the secret of Garston’s imploring glances.</p>

<p>There had been no lingering cloud over the table,
and no shade of Banquo was evoked to chill the later
merriment. Love, veiled and unveiled, deftly footed
it, among the revelers, and, only Doctor Alberg’s
steady eyes, anxiously fixed upon his “star” patient,
proved that but one, besides Vreeland, realized the
desperate battle against Time which Elaine Willoughby
was fighting out to the last. The egoistic revelers
imagined their hostess’ seizure to be a mere passing
weakness. They all knew the strain of the exhausting
New York season.</p>

<p>“Charming woman, our hostess,” frankly remarked
Senator Garston to Vreeland. “Type all unknown to
our modest Marthas of the Occident. Here in America,
our women will soon be crowned queens, if I may
trust to the ‘tiara’ bearing stories of the society
journals.” And a casual remark from Vreeland
brought out the admission that Senator Garston had
never before met the hostess. “It was to my colleague,
Alynton, that I owe the honor of this presentation,”
said the newly-made toga wearer. “And, as Mrs. Willoughby
has been so kind to my ward, Miss Norreys,
in this new acquaintance, both pleasure and duty join
hands.”</p>

<p><a id="png.194" href="#png.194"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>192<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>But, the startled Vreeland, pacing his silent room
had several times exclaimed, in his lonely rounds while
waiting for Alberg, “James Garston, you are a cool-headed,
thorough-paced liar! I will trace you back,
my occidental friend, only to find ‘the wires crossed,’
somewhere in the past, and, from you, I will yet
wrench the secret of Elaine Willoughby’s early life.
Her child! Yes,” he cried, “It might well be.” He
was thrilling in every fibre, for, in the dressing room,
Justine had stolen to his side whispering:</p>

<p>“Doctor Alberg has sent for a trained nurse to help
me watch with her to-night. Be on your guard.</p>

<p>“When this new Senator had made his adieu, I was
hidden behind the curtain in the long hall. I saw him
neatly drop his glove, as if by accident. Alynton
and that tall golden-haired girl were waiting outside as
he stole back.” The French woman fairly hissed,
“He is the man to fear. I am sure they are old lovers.
For, he caught her by both hands and fairly devoured
her with his eyes.</p>

<p>“‘To-morrow, alone, at Lakemere,’ she said. <i lang="fr">Voilà!</i>
Milady. Just a woman, like the rest of us.”</p>

<p>“Justine, that paper, the one in her corset. A
thousand dollars for a copy of it.”</p>

<p>“I will get it to-night!” the velvet-eyed spy cried.</p>

<p>“Go now. You will hear from me soon. Don’t leave
your room for a moment, and, <i lang="fr">gare la</i> Kelly. She
reports daily on you to our full-blown <i lang="fr">ingenue</i>. Whatever
turns up, you will surely hear from me. I’ll earn
your money yet.”</p>

<p>It was five o’clock when the haggard German physician
crawled up Vreeland’s stair. He was worn and
exhausted.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a night of it,” he savagely cried, “give me
<a id="png.195" href="#png.195"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>193<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a glass of real brandy. No slops. That poor devil of
a woman has had fainting fits one after the other.
I’ve now got Martha Wilmot, my only really reliable
nurse, watching her. The devil of it is, Madame will
go up to Lakemere at ten o’clock, and she vows she will,
alone. The house there is shut up. It is not even
properly warmed. She will come back, and have a
relapse, but what can I do. She has an iron will.”</p>

<p>The angry Teuton drank a second dram and then
relapsed into a sullen silence.</p>

<p>“Alberg, my boy, you are a good doctor, but, you
don’t know women, only your blue-eyed, clumsy frauleins,
over there. This American woman is made of
fire and flame. Tell me, what sort of a person is your
nurse, Wilmot?”</p>

<p>“She’s a good one—an ‘out and outer.’ She goes
home to England next week. She has some ideas of
her own to work out over there.”</p>

<p>“Tell that smart woman to slip down here and see
me before our patient comes back. I’ll be here from
four to seven to-day. And, mind that you put her
‘dead on’ to me, as the holder of a hundred pound note
for her.”</p>

<p>“Good,” grunted Alberg.</p>

<p>“And, now, my son of Galen, what was it that upset
Mrs. Willoughby?” Vreeland was eagerly studying
the German’s face.</p>

<p>“The old thing. She has raved all night about her
child. I only brought her out of the attack with the
strongest anti-spasmodics that man dare to use, short
of clear cold murder. It’s a terrible risk,” sighed
Alberg.</p>

<p>When Doctor Hugo Alberg left the Elmleaf, he was
under the spell of his lying coadjutor, and richer by a
<a id="png.196" href="#png.196"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>194<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>few hundred dollars. “This fellow must never even
lift the veil of the Temple,” muttered Vreeland.
“Only trust to Justine. Only Justine,” he cried, as
he threw himself down to sleep, after ordering the
wondering Bagley to send Miss Kelly home on her
arrival, and also that dark-eyed enigma, Miss Garland.
He needed solitude.</p>

<p>“I am ill, and, must have a long sleep. You can
take a day off yourself. Clear out for the day and
don’t let me hear a single footfall about my rooms,”
were the staccato injunctions of the excited schemer.</p>

<p>“If that nurse only comes,” he murmured, as he
closed his weary eyes.</p>

<p>It was eleven o’clock when a light step echoed in
Vreeland’s hall, and the swishing sound of Justine
Duprez’s robe made the banker leap to his door. The
French girl had her will at last. She stood amid the
splendors of Vreeland’s veiled Paradise—her lover’s
home.</p>

<p>She cried out in glee, “Thank God! She is out of
the way. I came here from the train. She absolutely
forbade me to go with her. I have had the janitor’s
boy watching all the trains. This Senator Garston
went up the road an hour ago. The smart boy helped
us last night in the cloak rooms, and, so, they are off
alone together, up there, to-day.”</p>

<p>Vreeland’s eyes blazed in a mighty triumph.
“To-night, you must help me, Justine,” cried the
eager schemer.</p>

<p>“See here. I already have stolen what you want,”
cried Justine. “You said it was worth a thousand dollars.
I copied even every mark on the hidden papers,
and, I went over it a dozen times, while the new nurse
was with her. Madame was insensible, and, I had
<a id="png.197" href="#png.197"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>195<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>time to work in safety. What will you give me,
now?”</p>

<p>She was not listened too, for with a ferocious joy,
Vreeland leaped up, crying, “My God! I have her now.
They are all in the hollow of my hand.”</p>

<p>He had glanced over the list of names written there,
and a row of figures with some characters added,
which seemed to glow before him in living flame.</p>

<p>He drew the Frenchwoman to his side, and there
dashed off a check to his own order and carefully
indorsed it.</p>

<p>“There’s your money, you jewel,” he gasped.
“Listen. To-night, when she comes back, or to-morrow
night, if she is again under the nurse’s watch, you must
steal that envelope again. I will be waiting outside
the Circassia, and stay all of both nights till I get the
original paper that you copied. Put a simple sheet of
blank paper back in the envelope and close it up.
Sew it up again in the same place in her corset.</p>

<p>“We will leave that to be stolen by the nurse, Martha
Wilmot. She will know what to do with it.</p>

<p>“She clears out of here for Europe in a few days.
She will keep well out of Mrs. Willoughby’s way.
And, so the Madame will think that she has been
robbed by our sly, English friend. I will pay the nurse
well and help her away. But that <em>original paper</em>
must come to me.</p>

<p>“Be sure to leave Mrs. Willoughby’s garments where
the nurse could easily reach them—no one shall suspect
you. I’ll hold you safe—it is our own secret.
Alberg will, of course, raise a devil of a row about the
nurse clearing out, and robbing him, but only after
she is gone.”</p>

<p><a id="png.198" href="#png.198"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>196<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“And my mistress. <i lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i> But, how I fear
her!” faltered the trembling Justine.</p>

<p>“Nonsense. The woman comes down here to-day.
She will get her orders from me. You can put this
blank envelope with its paper filling back in the corset,
so that Mrs. Willoughby will feel that something is
there. And, now, about tapping her telephone and
telegraph wires.”</p>

<p>Justine had finished a glass of wine when she
sprang to her feet. “To-day is the day of days. The
janitor, August Helms, is all ready to tie on the wires
to tap her telegraph and telephone. Come up to the
Circassia at noon. I will take you into his room by the
back way. He has arranged all with Mulholland, one
of the two letter-carriers, to always delay Mrs. Willoughby’s
mail by one delivery. Mulholland can
hold them all for himself to handle. And, Helms, in
his room, will then open and copy any we need. He
is a German adept in letter opening.”</p>

<p>“You are a genius, Justine,” cried Vreeland. “You
can bring Helms down to your own room in South Fifth
Avenue and there you and I together can square up
with him. We must be two to his one. This is the
very day of days while she is fondly lingering at Lakemere
with her own oldest lover.</p>

<p>“And now, my girl, take a good look around my den
and then get out of here. It is too dangerous for us.</p>

<p>“For, you must never come here again. The
janitor has sharp eyes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and, the new ‘Mees Gairland’ is many evenings
now, with that little Kelly devil. Look out for them
both. You can only trust me,” nodded Justine, as she
fled away, whispering, “I will come down into the
court of the Circassia and meet you, in the entrance,
<a id="png.199" href="#png.199"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>197<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as if by hazard at noon precisely. All you have to do is
to silently follow me. I will have that paper by midnight
if I live and the nurse shall have the blame.”</p>

<p>The rooms echoed to the laughter of hell as Vreeland’s
fiery devil whispered, “Victory!” He had at
last solved the mystery of a “business syndicate”
which made him tremble as he feared its name might
escape his lips. The copied paper gave a list of
names whose publication would shake a nation’s counsels,
and Garston’s name was there.</p>

<p>So, tiger-like and triumphant, he waited for the
hour to go and arrange for his secret stealing of his
dupe’s messages.</p>

<p>And, far away, at lonely Lakemere, where the trees
now gleamed like ghastly silver skeletons of summer’s
glories, the winds wailed around the silent mansion
where Elaine Willoughby stood face to face with the
man who had come out of her dead past, an apparition
as grim and awful to her as the rising of the sheeted
dead.</p>

<p>It was the struggle to the death of two proud and
world-hardened hearts. The secret of her blighted
youth was face to face with her now. And, the shadow
of a crime hung menacingly over James Garston, the
toga wearer. A statesman of a clouded past—a past
known only to the defiant woman facing him on her own
battle-ground.</p>

<p>“I find you here under a stolen name, facing the
world, as a living lie.” The woman’s scornful lips
had lashed into his quivering heart. Garston, bold-brave,
reckless now with a mad tide of desire sweeping
over his reawakened heart, had seized her hands.
He cried, passionately: “And, I find my lost wife, the
<a id="png.200" href="#png.200"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>198<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>mother of our child, here, a lovely, and a glowing
truth.”</p>

<p>When he would have drawn her to him, she flung
him off and dropped, a shaken Niöbe, into a chair, with
her stormy tears raining over her beautiful, pallid
face. That single word, “child,” had disarmed her
rising anger. For, she was facing one who knew all
of the sealed past.</p>

<p>“My child, my child,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>But, James Garston was on his knees before her now.</p>

<p>“<em>Our child</em>—Margaret! It can all be made right,
now. Trust to me. Let me take you openly to my
heart. Be my wife once more. Be a world’s queen.
I will make you happy.”</p>

<p>Bold as he was, he shuddered, as she sprang to
her feet. “You hound!” she bitterly cried, and then
slowly turned, and walked unsteadily to the door. He
had found a way to wring her heart at last, but her
courage had returned. The wrongs of her youth
burned in her bosom again.</p>

<p>“Hear me. You must! You shall!” he pleaded,
seizing her in his strong arms. “I knew not even the
horn book of my own nature when we married as
young fools marry.” She had torn herself away from
him, and stood at bay with an unutterable loathing
hardening upon her face. “I am rich, now, a Senator
to be, and the friend of your friends.</p>

<p>“You dare not openly defy me. For, I can publicly
claim you as mine. I demand to see our child. I offer
you myself—the matured man—a leader of men. I
offer you a secured, honored place in Washington life.
And, you need me, for I can throw down your house
of cards. When Alynton told me of the wonder-worker,
the Queen of the Street, the Lady of
<a id="png.201" href="#png.201"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>199<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Lakemere, I was merely interested. But, when I saw you,
last night, my heart leaped up. For mine you were,
mine you are—mine you shall be.”</p>

<p>The strong man counted upon the physical subjection
of the woman once reduced to be his loving vassal—the
girl wife who had lain in his arms.</p>

<p>And, master of her destiny once, he would now
bend her to his will again.</p>

<p>His eyes were burning, his breath came quickly, and
he awaited the physical revulsion of a weakened
womanhood.</p>

<p>“There is always the tie that binds—the child—and,
she belongs by Nature’s bond to me.”</p>

<p>But, the man who coarsely counted upon “a previous
condition of servitude” as establishing a valid claim
upon the Lady of Lakemere, shivered under the cold
scorn of her words, for the wife of his youth seated
herself, and, gazing into his eyes with an unutterable
contempt, read the death warrant of his hopes.</p>

<p>“Let me cast up our accounts, here, now, in my
home, Arnold Cranstoun, on this winter day, in a solitude
on which you shall never intrude again save when
I call upon you.</p>

<p>“The dead past is buried. Let it rest. Dare not to
cry <i lang="la">Resurgam</i>! I dismiss all your sneers as to
Alynton, and, I fear not your circle. You are as yet,
but a clumsy neophyte there.</p>

<p>“Know, once for all, that your friends are in my
power, but they trust to me, and, I am more than
worthy of their confidence.</p>

<p>“For another circle of men of boundless power also
trust me—men who would not trust them, save
through me, and, men who would resistlessly crush
you at my bidding.</p>

<p><a id="png.202" href="#png.202"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>200<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I speak now for the woman who is dead.</p>

<p>“Margaret Cranstoun, the woman heart slain by your
cowardice, the loving and tender girl-wife. Look
back nineteen long years to see yourself the trusted
bank-cashier, a rising man of thirty-two.</p>

<p>“I was then your slave, your loving slave, a wearer of
self-forced heart shackles. I, the girl of seventeen,
believed you to be my lover husband—a man among
men.”</p>

<p>Senator James Garston’s head was bowed in his
hands, as the accusing voice rang out. He heard the
knell of his last hopes.</p>

<p>“A year later, when you basely fled, leaving me, the
mother of your two months’ old helpless girl to face the
employers whom you had robbed in your hidden speculations,
then, only then, I learned of your double life
in New York. I knew that I was the innocent hostage
of purity and honor. The screen of your dearest
vices.”</p>

<p>Garston groaned as the voice rose high in its scorn
and Elaine Willoughby stood before him, with outstretched
arm, an angel with a flaming sword, at the
shut gates of his Lost Paradise.</p>

<p>“Where you fled to I knew not—I cared not, for,
with young blood and a loving heart, I might even
have shared the fate of a bold sinner.</p>

<p>“But a sneaking coward must learn that woman’s
heart condones not poltrooning nor meanness!</p>

<p>“You would now hold the dead past over my head—trumpet
to the world your own story!” she cried. “I
can easily confirm it. I have kept all your letters—the
story of your crime, the papers and vouchers which
were found in your New York room.</p>

<p>“Your letters of egoistic love, your later whining
<a id="png.203" href="#png.203"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>201<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>apologies from your unknown Western haunt. And
armed with these, <em>I</em> could chase James Garston from
the Senate.”</p>

<p>The suffering man sprang up. “Not so. I have a
right to my name. I legally changed it years ago.
The bank is long years out of existence; there is also
the limitation of the past years. No one would believe
you.”</p>

<p>His voice was broken with helpless tears now.</p>

<p>“Look at me! look at me!” the splendid woman
proudly cried. “Dare any man say that my life has
been a lie? Hear my story.</p>

<p>“Starvation, cold charity or the ignominy of helpless
dependence was all you left me. I put our babe away.
I went out a toiler into the world. As a school teacher
I drifted away to the far West, and only changed my
name. I left our home to avoid the honest love of
good men who would have married me for pity’s sake.
For men were good to the shamed widowed Margaret
Cranstoun.</p>

<p>“My clean hands were still linked by law to the
unpunished fugitive felon. <em>I am free now</em>, and I know
that you never would dare to speak. I know your
coward soul. A judicial decree that you are dead can
be easily had; your eighteen years of absence makes
that my legal right. Widow of the heart, I will be a
widow by law. But your coward silence will continue.</p>

<p>“Where did I gain wealth? I see the question in
your eyes. I became a school teacher at Leadville.
A few acres of ground and a cottage were the first
fruits of my savings.</p>

<p>“The kindly mountain gnomes worked for me, with
fairy friendship.</p>

<p>“There was a million in carbonates under those
<a id="png.204" href="#png.204"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>202<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>rocky slopes where I tempted the hardy flower to grow.</p>

<p>“Young yet—<em>beautiful then</em>—I became the ardent
chase of men in marriage. My gold gilded my lonely
life. Many wished to share it.</p>

<p>“I was made sadly wise, and I reaped my harvest of
sorrows. Five years in Europe made me a woman of
the world—an accomplished world wanderer. I have
learned in these lonely years the delicious power of
wealth.</p>

<p>“I followed your secret example. I legally changed
my name to Elaine Willoughby. And my honest title
is clearer than yours.</p>

<p>“I have an able lawyer to defend my rights, in whom
you would find an implacable foe.”</p>

<p>She paused and spoke the final doom of his hopes.</p>

<p>“Had you come to me, red-handed, but loving, I
might have forgiven you, followed you—loved you
even in your crime—and suffered all to shield the one
beloved head. <em>I did love you once with my whole soul.</em>”</p>

<p>There was the sound of choking sobs, and in an
instant, Garston was on his knees before her. The
silence was broken by her faltering accents.</p>

<p>“But now, freed by Nature’s reincarnation, loyal
even yet to a dead past, I exult in the unchallenged
ownership of my mind, body and soul. You would
take to your bosom the woman you still find fair, rich,
powerful and respected. <em>Never! Nature revolts!</em></p>

<p>“For the starving outcast of the streets who sells
herself for bread to the first chance comer were white
as snow compared to the woman who would again sink
to your level.</p>

<p>“Arnold Cranstoun, any man in the world but you
may look on me with longing eyes.</p>

<p>“<em>Between us there is the gulf of your eternal shame!</em>
<a id="png.205" href="#png.205"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>203<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Now, <em>leave me</em>. I fear you not! Let all else go on as
fate ordains.</p>

<p>“Your silence will be assured, for fear will seal your
lips. Let there be neither approach nor avoidance—simply
the oblivion of the absolute divorce of all laws,
God’s, Nature’s, and man’s.</p>

<p>“Go now! If you ever seek to cross my path,
beware! You may haunt the peopled solitudes
around me and meet me as a chance acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Your ‘society drill’ will hold you in your place in
the poor parade of this superficial life.”</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes, and her impassioned voice
echoed sadly on his ears. He was defeated, and an
agony rent his heart.</p>

<p>“Let me do something for you, Margaret,” he
pleaded.</p>

<p>“I am above your power to aid,” the proud woman
replied.</p>

<p>“Let me atone,” he begged.</p>

<p>“Dead beyond awakening is my heart, and you know
it. Do not now add a hideous insult to Nature to your
cowardly abandonment of the past.”</p>

<p>The dull, level coldness of her voice proved to him
that she bore a frozen heart, one never to awaken at
his touch. He cast himself down before her in a last
appeal.</p>

<p>And then, on his knees before the woman whom he
had sworn to cherish “till death do us part,” the strong
man pleaded for the child whom fate had robbed from
the clinging arms of its mother. Margaret Cranstoun
sobbed:</p>

<p>“<em>The child!</em> Oh, my God! <em>Never!</em> Name not her
name. Me, your victim or your sacrifice. Her name
shall never cross your lips. Wherever God’s mercy
<a id="png.206" href="#png.206"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>204<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>takes that innocent one, she shall live and die fatherless—save
for Him above. I swear it, on the memory
of a mother’s natal anguish. And <em>now</em>, Senator James
<span class="nw">Garston,—”</span></p>

<p>The stately woman stood before him with the menace
of a life in her eyes.</p>

<p>“<em>This is the end of all!</em> Go! You are safe from my
vengeance now. I care not how you have dragged
yourself up on Fortune’s wheel.</p>

<p>“Go! And if you ever break the sorrow-shaded stillness
of my life, then, may God help you. For I will strike
you down for the sake of that same fatherless child.”</p>

<p>A black storm of suddenly aroused jealousy swept
over Garston’s face.</p>

<p>“Your handsome lover Vreeland shall be my prey,
my tool, my confidant. I will creep into your heart
through your own pleasant vice. And, by God! <em>He
shall find out the girl for me.</em>”</p>

<p>When James Garston’s passion-blinded eyes cleared,
he was standing there alone, and a sudden fear smote
upon him.</p>

<p>The ghastly silence of the splendid deserted halls
weighed upon him. He staggered out into the blinding
snows, now falling, and crossed the park to where
a sleigh waited at the garden gate.</p>

<p>He was half mad, as he wandered away under the
trees, and he hurled away his revolver lest he should
be tempted to die there before her windows.</p>

<p>“I have lost a woman upon whose breast a king’s
head might proudly rest,” he said to that ghost of his
dead self which rose up to mock the man of mark, the
millionaire. “And—<em>she loved me once</em>. Fool—<em>fool</em>—and—<em>blind
fool!</em>” he muttered.</p>

<p>A mad resolve thrilled him now.</p>

<p><a id="png.207" href="#png.207"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>205<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“The child! By God! <em>she would hide her. The world
is not wide enough.</em> There’s my money—and this
young fellow Vreeland. I have a lure for him.”</p>

<p>His busy brain thrilled with plots of the one revenge
left to him. “I will steal away both child and lover!”
he swore.</p>

<p>Senator Garston’s face was sternly composed that
night as he indited his invitation to the rising young
banker to join him at the Plaza.</p>

<p>“Katie Norreys can soon twist him around her slim,
white fingers—he is young and rash,” the cold-hearted
millionaire mused. “I am safe in Margaret’s silence.
My money will talk. My record is safe. I have made
my calling and election sure. I’ll get Vreeland into
the fair Katie’s hands.</p>

<p>“A little money will help. He shall be turned away
from Margaret. Once that I have the girl, then
Margaret will surely soften—for that child’s sake. <em>By
God! I’ll buy the girl’s heart!</em> I have money enough,
and I’ll outbid even Mrs. Elaine Willoughby.”</p>

<p>The Senator-elect felt a new glow in his heart, the
ardor of a wolf-like chase, an untiring chase, for love,
passion, and vengeance carried him on.</p>

<p>“I’ll live to laugh at her heroics yet,” he cried, “for
I will bring her into camp. <em>I am not accustomed to
fail.</em>” He was resolute now.</p>

<p>The lights were gleaming golden in the Circassia
when a pale-faced woman crept back to the splendors
of the pearl boudoir.</p>

<p>No one had marked Senator James Garston’s visit to
Lakemere, and the two caretakers—man and wife—marveled
at their mistress’ agitation when she bade
them escort her back to New York City. The gardener
summoned to watch over the lonely mansion grumbled:
<a id="png.208" href="#png.208"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>206<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“I never saw her look like that.” For the brave
woman was now “paying the price.” It was the reflex
swing of the pendulum of Life.</p>

<p>Could the three humble servitors have heard the
accusing cry of Elaine Willoughby’s heart they would
have known the anguish of a stricken woman’s arraignment
of Providence.</p>

<p>“And he—oh, my God! <em>He prospers</em>, while my
child is taken from me! Is this the price of my
mother’s love, my empty heart, my vacant home, my
death in life!”</p>

<p>It seemed as if God had spared the wrongdoer to
smite her quivering mother heart.</p>

<p>Dr. Hugo Alberg and the stolid-faced Martha
Wilmot were busily whispering in a corner of Mrs. Willoughby’s sick room that night long after midnight
had sounded on the frosty air.</p>

<p>For, relaxed and broken by the enforced bravery of
her struggle with the father of her lost child, the Lady
of Lakemere had crept, bruised and wounded in soul,
back to die or live, she cared not, in the peopled
wilderness of the two million souls who envied her the
lonely luxuries of her life.</p>

<p>“She has had one dose,” whispered Alberg. “She
is dead safe to sleep till three o’clock. Give her this
chloral carefully then. Get your work done as soon
as you can, and at eight o’clock your expected telegram
will call you away. The French woman will watch till
the new nurse comes. You have seen young Vreeland?”</p>

<p>The Doctor’s eyes glowed like live coals.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she whispered. “<em>It’s all right</em>,” and her
fingers tightly closed on the vial. “I am to meet him at
the ferry. <em>The boat sails at eleven.</em> It will be all right.”</p>

<p><a id="png.209" href="#png.209"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>207<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Dr. Alberg passed out of the sick-room, and Justine
Duprez followed him down the stair.</p>

<p>“You have left all where she can do the work?”
whispered the miserly German, who already had the
price of his treason in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured Justine. “I’ll tell you all when
we meet down there.”</p>

<p>The hoodwinked physician went out into the night,
whispering: “I’ll be here at seven, on the watch.”</p>

<p>It was but half an hour later that a man seated in
August Helms’ darkened basement room opened his
arms as Justine Duprez glided in.</p>

<p>“She is sleeping like a log,” murmured the maid.
“<em>Here is what you want.</em> The nurse will do her part
later, and be sure that she clears out at once. I’ll keep
the Doctor with me here till noon. She will get her
‘sudden telegram;’ he will be here on duty; while he
is busied with the new nurse Martha will go and rob the
Doctor’s office and rooms, and be soon on the sea.
Then we are all covered.”</p>

<p>The schemer’s eyes gleamed as he pocketed the paper
which made his patroness an involuntary traitor to her
dangerous trust. Vreeland breathed in a happy
triumph.</p>

<p>“You must not leave your rooms to-morrow. Keep
in sight of the Kelly girl,” warned the Frenchwoman.
“<em>Now I will steal away.</em>”</p>

<p>There were words murmured which bound the two
wretches to each other, and they laughed as they
pointed to the janitor’s new telegraphic instrument
and telephone.</p>

<p>“A great convenience to the patrons of the Circassia,”
laughed Vreeland. He alone knew how deftly the
crafty August Helms had seized upon
<a id="png.210" href="#png.210"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>208<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Mrs. Willoughby’s absence of the day to effect the joining of the
skilfully hidden wires tapping the lines which led to
the Hanover Bank building and joined Judge Endicott’s
private office to Mrs. Willoughby’s pearl boudoir.</p>

<p>“When I have the extra instrument in my own
room,” he exulted, “then if Miss Romaine Garland is
not approachable I will soon find another more
malleable.</p>

<p>“But the secret firm of Endicott &amp; Willoughby will
talk into my ear when they think that the whole world
is theirs. <em>It’s a royal plan</em>,” he mused.</p>

<p>Justine’s gliding step had died away when Harold
Vreeland crept out like a guilty thief.</p>

<p>“Where shall I hide this original,” he muttered, as
he disappeared in the darkness. “<em>I must find a place
in my rooms. I cannot carry it about me.</em>”</p>

<p>When he had regained the Elmleaf he dared hardly
breathe as he carefully examined the original document
which tied up the fate of the Sugar Syndicate with
that of men whose very names he feared to utter.</p>

<p>“She is in my power at last. Her ruin is in my hands.</p>

<p>“And now to bring her into my arms to be my fond
tool and willing slave.”</p>

<p>There was no “stock plunging” for two long weeks, as
the illness of Mrs. Willoughby dragged on, and Martha
Wilmot was well across the seas before the police of
New York City had ceased to blunder around after the
ungrateful nurse who had seemingly robbed her benefactor’s
office and then decamped.</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Vreeland was astounded at the golden
sunshine of Senator James Garston’s favors which
followed on that luncheon at the Plaza Hotel which
had made him a sworn knight in the rosy chains of
Miss Katharine VanDyke Norreys.</p>

<p><a id="png.211" href="#png.211"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>209<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>There was little to do, for the market was quiescent.</p>

<p>Miss Mary Kelly’s desk, too, was vacant, for she lay
at home ill with a fever, and it was at the side of the
girl’s sick-bed that Mrs. Elaine Willoughby, still feeble
and shaken in soul, suddenly seized a photograph from
the mantel. “Whose picture is this?” she cried,
her voice trembling in the throes of an emotion which
swept her loving soul with wonderment and a new
hope.</p>

<p class="chaphead">MISS MARBLE’S WATERLOO!—A LOST LAMB!—HER
VACANT CHAIR.—SENATOR GARSTON’S DISCLOSURE.—SARA
CONYERS’ MISSION.—MISS GARLAND’S
DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE.—A DEFIANCE TO
THE DEATH.—“ROBBED!”</p>


<p>In the two weeks after the successful affixing of
those snake-like coils of wire which led the private
messages of Mme. Elaine Willoughby into janitor
Helms’ guarded private apartment, Mr. Harold Vreeland
had effected a thorough understanding with that
worthy. The trapping devices worked to a charm.
All was now ready for a final betrayal.</p>

<p>Secure in his autocratic rule, August Helms buried
his shock head in the beer seidl and tyrannized with a
good-humored roughness over the cringing tradesmen
visiting the Circassia, and, a greedy gossip, he made
his “coign of vantage” a warm nook for letter-carrier
and policeman and the high class “upper servants”
of the families who lived above him, in a royal
Americanized luxury in that great social fortress, the
Circassia. Helms was a modern tyrant.</p>

<p>His round, gray-blue eye twinkled as Justine Duprez
would slyly slip in and read off the printed tape of the
Wheatstone instrument, a duplicate sender and receiver
of the same pattern being neatly encased in a pretty
<a id="png.213" href="#png.213"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>211<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>cabinet in the pearl boudoir above. And Mrs. Willoughby doubted, feared, suspected—nothing.</p>

<p>But all in vain did Helms record the telephoned
messages which were trapped on the instrument which
was his especial care. There was nothing to record of
moment. A lull seemed to hover over every speculative
interest of the convalescent woman.</p>

<p>The stillness of death now marked Mr. Harold
Vreeland’s “business department” at the Elmleaf.
The illness of Mary Kelly had cut off all special
communication with Mrs. Willoughby at the Circassia,
and he had been forced to give Miss Romaine Garland
a furlough “under full pay” until Mrs. Willoughby’s
trusted operator could resume her desk. The young
girl shunned any <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> labors. It was in virtue of
a warning from the acute Joanna Marble that Vreeland
gravely bade his mysterious beauty rest herself and
“await further orders.”</p>

<p>“She is of the finer clay,” warningly remarked Miss
Joanna. “One toss of that proud head and she would
be off like a startled fawn. You must trust to a
woman—only a woman—to lead a woman on. Beware
of rashness. You would lose her.”</p>

<p>There was an <i>innocuous desuetude</i> now clinging to all
Vreeland’s crippled plans.</p>

<p>For, soberly attentive in his duty calls, he had left
daily cards at the Circassia, supplemented with flowers
whose dreaming beauty might have touched a heart
less wrung than Elaine’s.</p>

<p>Admitted but once to her presence, he marveled at
the serious change in her appearance.</p>

<p>After receiving her orders, he now knew that he
was free for a month to follow on his social pleasures
and to watch, down in Wall Street, the executive
<a id="png.214" href="#png.214"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>212<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>matters of the firm and note the gradual liquidation,
dollar for dollar, of all proved claims against the
defunct firm of Hathorn &amp; Wolfe.</p>

<p>He recognized the cool-headed sifting of Mr. James
Potter’s lawyers, under the mandates of that young
Crœsus in Paris.</p>

<p>“A fair, square settlement, dollar for dollar,” was
Potter’s openly avowed business plan.</p>

<p>The last flurries of the sudden Sugar speculations
had all died away, and Vreeland at last believed Mrs. Willoughby’s description of the market.</p>

<p>“There is nothing in sight. I shall let all speculation
alone until Dr. Alberg pronounces me able to
stand business excitement. Your time is your own till
I call you back to your post and send Miss Kelly down
to her work again. She will act as my private
secretary until I am thoroughly well.”</p>

<p>And Vreeland, now fearful that he might be as
suddenly dropped as Frederick Hathorn had been,
forbore to press on the confidence of the woman whose
thinned cheeks and hollow eyes told of some internal
fires eating away her vitality. He was unable to
extract any information of value from Dr. Hugo
Alberg. And the thieving nurse was now safe over
the sea—the robbery of the envelope still undiscovered.</p>

<p>The German medical worthy was really puzzled. In
the secrecy of Vreeland’s rooms he confided that
though all the depression of the skillfully administered
overdoses of chloral had worn away, his patient was
wearing herself to the verge of a collapse.</p>

<p>“Mental trouble! mental trouble!” he growled.
“Neither Justine nor my new nurse (whom I dare not
fully trust) can gain the slightest clew to her sorrows.
The Madame has grown cat-like, too, in her secretive
<a id="png.215" href="#png.215"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>213<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ways. There is old Endicott always hovering around,
and that newspaper fellow, Hugh Conyers; and,
besides, his raw-boned artist sister, Miss Sara, is
closeted with her nearly every evening. What they
are all up to is a devil’s wonder.</p>

<p>“Are they plucking her of her gold? There is such
a thing as social blackmail. Any lonely woman of fortune
usually has a ring of hungry sycophants around her.”</p>

<p>The German groaned helplessly. He wanted that
same gold, and wanted it badly.</p>

<p>“And you, of course, think that you should be the
king-pin of the whole machine,” sneered Vreeland.
The half-angered German snorted a warning.</p>

<p>“Look out for yourself,” growled Alberg. “She
does not let the French maid go out of her sight now,
and her new nurse has not dared to leave. Remember,
I will hold you responsible about the stolen envelope.
I have covered up my own tracks.”</p>

<p>And then he proudly exhibited the newspaper
clipping headed, “An Ungrateful Protégé,” which
described the heartless pillaging of Dr. Alberg’s office
and rooms by “Miss Martha Wilmot,” who had
“decamped for parts unknown.” The police detective
opinions and the portentous interviews were all set out
in extenso.</p>

<p>“When Milady finds that she was<!-- TN: sic --> been robbed, too,
then look out for squalls,” was the parting admonition
of the Doctor. It brought grave shadows to Vreeland’s
face.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland was startled when his dupe left
him. For it now flashed over him that his evening
<i lang="fr">cartes de visite</i> had lately only elicited the same
stereotyped answer: “Mrs. Willoughby is too unwell
to see anyone.”</p>

<p><a id="png.216" href="#png.216"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>214<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>He had, however, “improved the shining hours” by a
flank movement to the Hotel Savoy, where he had
drifted far, very far, into the good graces of that
sparkling heiress, Miss Katharine Norreys. And his
daily welcome grew warmer with each visit. He was
getting on famously.</p>

<p>Senator James Garston’s absence “on Washington
visits,” with the usual trips of a busy money magnate
from fever center to fever center of the golden whirlpool,
had left the young man to “exploit” the many
graces of the tall, willowy blonde. He had often
mused over the possibility of an advantageous alliance.
“Here is a woman, young, rich, and with a powerful
Senatorial backing. I might even be able to get inside
the ring. For now I hold the secret of a combination
which no one dares avow. It would be my ruin,
however, to use it until the time comes to rule or crush
Mrs. Willoughby. She must be my ‘golden goose’—she
alone—and, I must not kill her too soon.”</p>

<p>A long introspection proved to him that his old
“waiting game” was the only safe plan.</p>

<p>“If Garston makes up to me, I can meet him half
way. Perhaps he might exchange the secret of my sly
patroness’ early life for the golden key to the Sugar
situation. Together we could surely control her. And
acting alone, I might easily be crushed between this
secretly warring couple.</p>

<p>“But, when their dual secret is mine, then I can
always act against my weakest foe. They will never
dare get rid of me then,” he craftily premised,
for he saw gold ahead—solid, easily earned gold. And
the busy devil in his cold heart laughed and made
merry.</p>

<p>But one circumstance now disquieted him as to the
<a id="png.217" href="#png.217"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>215<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>resplendent Miss Katharine VanDyke Norreys—the
absence of a respectable, social womanly background.</p>

<p>There was no doubt as to the tangible luxury of her
daily life, and the deep respect shown by the Hotel
Savoy management spoke of that regular payment of
bills which endears “the guest” to the Boniface.</p>

<p>“A certain number of women friends are a <i lang="la">sine qua
non</i>, however, to a ‘professed beauty,’” mused Vreeland.</p>

<p>“Their absence is as remarkable as a bedizened
general riding out all alone into the enemy’s land with
no following. I presume that ‘prominent Westerners’
will in due time furnish her with a golden woman bodyguard.
Garston being a widower, too, is another awkward
thing.”</p>

<p>In the whole embarrassing situation, all that Vreeland
could do to move on his plans was to make a stolen
visit to the rooms of the janitor of the Circassia.</p>

<p>There Justine Duprez, in a few moments of stolen
time, breathlessly told him of the nightly conferences.
“I think that she is soon going abroad. They have
maps and papers out every evening. So far she has
not examined her hidden paper. When she does, there
will be a wild storm.</p>

<p>“And then only at my room in South Fifth Avenue
dare we meet. We must be watchful. For the little
green-eyed typewriter, Mary Kelly, spies on me, and
I find her blue-coated friend, too, that big policeman,
Daly the Roundsman, following me around. Look out
for yourself. You and I must stand or fall together.
She may give us both the slip. If she went over to
Paris, and took me with her, you dare not follow her;
but I could write to you always, and give you a safe
address to write to me.”</p>

<p><a id="png.218" href="#png.218"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>216<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Vreeland was vaguely disturbed at heart.</p>

<p>“Can we trust to August Helms?” muttered Vreeland,
with a sudden shiver of underlying cowardice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” grimly said Justine, “as long as you pay
him, and, besides, he faces state’s prison in—you know—his
own part of the business. We must stand
together firmly, and you lead us on.”</p>

<p>As Vreeland regained his deserted rooms in the
Elmleaf he strangely recalled the last bitter denunciation
of the Lady of the Red Rose: “I leave it to
the future to punish you.”</p>

<p>But on his table, two letters awaited him which
brought a glow of secret delight to his heart.</p>

<p>A note from Senator James Garston bidding him
name a day for a <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> dinner at the Plaza closed
with these words of hope:</p>

<p>“I wish to enlist you in some matters of moment
which may turn out to our mutual advantage. You are
just the kind of a man that I feel I can work with.
Please telegraph the date to me at the Arlington Hotel,
Washington, and I will meet you—the sooner the
better.</p>

<p>“It is unnecessary to say that this is a matter
leading to a strictly confidential business association,
and so, not a word of my coming, even to Miss
Norreys.</p>

<p>“I wish to see you alone, and if you will act with
me we shall both soon be busy.</p>

<p>“Just the leading card to draw him into my hands.
If he will only unbosom himself ever so little, then I
can soon tie Mrs. Willoughby down, for this is the man
she fears. Else why that stolen interview at Lakemere?
And from all knowledge of that, even Justine
<a id="png.219" href="#png.219"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>217<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was excluded. Let him but come forward, and they
are both mine.”</p>

<p>The second letter with its inclosure was the result of
a long struggle between Miss Joanna Marble and the
social reluctance of that “shy bird,” the stately Miss
Romaine Garland. Joanna had gained ground at last.</p>

<p>Vreeland smiled grimly as he read the corrupt
agent’s letter. It was an evening invitation couched
in his interest and skillfully arranged.</p>

<p>“You are to come at 10:30, sir—fashionable hours.
You will find me ready to greet you.</p>

<p>“The musicale and supper, with a little informal
dancing, will enable me to see that you escort Miss
Garland home. I shall be ‘suddenly indisposed,’ and
then you are easily the Prince Charming of the occasion.</p>

<p>“The hostess is a trusted friend of mine.</p>

<p>“But how ‘shy’ your beautiful bird is. Romaine has
called several times on me, and yet she will not give
me her personal address. She always receives her
letters at Station Q, General Delivery.</p>

<p>“And when I offered to come for her she said,
quietly: ‘I will call for you, dear Miss Marble, with
a carriage, and we can go together.’ I wonder is she
one of us after all—a <em>sly</em> bird, not a <em>shy</em> bird?”</p>

<p>The address given was that of a respectably situated
residence in the West Eighties, a region blessed with
slightly stiffening social aspirations toward “elitedom,”
as the journals deftly put it.</p>

<p>Senator James Garston in Washington was triumphant
as he read Vreeland’s dispatch fixing a date for the
private dinner. “I can easily tole this vain young
fellow on with Katharine,” he gleefully cried. “And
if I can only reach Margaret Cranstoun’s child, I will
soon bring her proud head back to my bosom.”</p>

<p><a id="png.220" href="#png.220"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>218<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The stern soldier of fortune mused long over olden
days, his days of youth and promise, when his girl-wife
was only a plighted bride, a woman of awakened heart,
“whose head, like an o’er-wearied dove, came fluttering
down to rest.”</p>

<p>“I will have them both,” the Senator swore. “Why
should my life’s harvest be but chaff?</p>

<p>“For, the child is mine. The mother was once mine,
and through fire and flood I’ll go on and prove my title
against the whole world.</p>

<p>“If this young favorite can only find me the hidden
girl, he shall not want for fortune, and a marriage
with Katharine Norreys will tie him forever to me.”</p>

<p>It all promised fair enough.</p>

<p>But, plot and counterplot was forgotten as Harold
Vreeland, superbly poised in his habitual adamantine
calm, edged his way into the listening circle of the
“select few” who had been gathered at Mrs. Ollie
Manson’s ambitious musicale. It was a gala evening
in the West End.</p>

<p>A furtive conference with Miss Marble had caused
him to slip into the hushed rooms during the period
when the <i lang="fr">convives</i> were hanging breathlessly upon Miss
Bettina Goldvogel’s rendering of “Beauty’s Eyes.”
The Prince Charming’s advent was unobserved.</p>

<p>When the music ceased, Vreeland, who had been
gazing upon Romaine Garland, a sweet and lonely
figure, seated there with her hands clasped and her
stately head bent, was alarmed as he pressed forward
through the unfamiliar throng.</p>

<p>There was a flush of sudden crimson on the tall
girl’s cheek, and then, a swift Diana, she passed on, a
vision of stately beauty in her unfamiliar evening
dress. The excited trickster was swift in her pursuit.</p>

<p><a id="png.221" href="#png.221"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>219<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Vreeland’s step was on the stair, but a warning
touch at once recalled him. With serpentine swing,
Miss Joanna Marble sought the secret precincts of the
robing rooms. “Let me handle this matter,” was the
whispered comment. “Wait below in the drawing-room.”</p>

<p>The effusive welcome of Mrs. Ollie Manson was lost
upon the man who had caught one glance of aversion
from those truthful eyes into which his veiled blandishments
had never brought one gleam of tenderness in
those long hours at the Elmleaf. “Had she taken the
alarm?”</p>

<p>When he was released from the little circle with its
<i lang="it">sotto voce</i> comments, “Clubman,” “Rich young banker,
my dear,” and other social incense, he saw the thin,
bewhiskered Mr. Solon Manson, with a startled expression,
handing Miss Romaine Garland down the front
steps to her waiting carriage.</p>

<p>It was a five minutes of agony, and the last strains of
“<i lang="it">Non è Ver</i>” had reverberated from Sig. Trombonini’s
swelling bosom before Miss Joanna Marble, her face
ashen with the pallor of rage, drew Vreeland into the
library.</p>

<p>“You’ll never see that young tragedy queen again,”
wrathfully whispered the angered woman. “She only
told her driver to take her to the elevated railroad
station at Ninetieth Street. I had posted the little
Manson to get her address.</p>

<p>“There must be someone nearer to her than you
ever will be. She is as deep as the sea, and she dared
to lash me with her icy tongue. ‘I see it all, Miss
Marble,’ she snapped out. ‘Your friendly invitation
was a lure to put me on a false basis with my elegant
employer.</p>

<p><a id="png.222" href="#png.222"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>220<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“‘You know the girl breadwinner has no protection
against such a man but the honest independence of
her daily labor. Should he bend to woo the woman who
stands mute before him daily, pencil in hand? I can
not meet my employer socially.’”</p>

<p>“And you?” breathlessly cried Vreeland.</p>

<p>“I stood mute; for I dared go no further. But I
have her picture, at any rate. I will have her secretly
shadowed.</p>

<p>“I will wager my head there is some one nearer and
dearer to the shy bird than Miss Majestic would have
me believe. You can’t blame me; I did my best.
But it has been a Waterloo.”</p>

<p>The listener swore a mighty oath in his sudden
jealous rage. Vreeland’s face hardened.</p>

<p>“See here, just lock her picture up in your private
safe. Do nothing—wait for me. I’ll follow up the
quest alone.”</p>

<p>“And there is five hundred dollars for your obedience,
and now, silence. I’ll stay here an hour and
jolly these people.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow at ten at your office. And if you
should meet her, simply ignore the matter.</p>

<p>“I shall tell her, of course, that Manson, an old
friend, asked me informally, and that our meeting was
brought about by pure chance.”</p>

<p>Miss Joanna Marble’s hard laugh rattled in her
“bony frame.” “I think our <i lang="fr">ingenue</i>, young as she is,
has already a little commencement of a ‘past,’ a little
‘jardin secret,’ where flowers of other days still
bloom.</p>

<p>“But I am in your hands. I will obey you. You
are the paymaster, and you know I am not ‘in business
for my health.’”</p>

<p><a id="png.223" href="#png.223"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>221<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>On his homeward way, Vreeland studied the stars
with an anxious brow.</p>

<p>“She shall not get away from me,” he swore. “I
wonder if Mary Kelly and she are now only duplicate
spies of the woman who once had a use for me, and
now fears the poor tools she has used. Did I get at
the whole Hathorn secret?</p>

<p>“That is forever sealed in poor Fred’s grave.”</p>

<p>He started as a brilliant golden star trailed over the
inky blackness of the night.</p>

<p>“That’s bad luck,” he gloomily reflected, as he
cursed the wary young girl’s divination of his clumsy
social trick. “It was a wretched botch,” he said, as he
angrily dismounted at his own door, and the failure
over-shadowed his gloomy slumbers.</p>

<p>Three days later, when Harold Vreeland gazed
across the dinner table at Senator James Garston’s
immutable face, he wondered what future intrigues
were hidden behind the mask of the strong man’s
assumed carelessness. They were alone, hidden in a
retired room of the Millionaires’ Club, and, as of old,
Harold Vreeland, played his waiting game. The two
men were fairly matched—past masters of deceit.</p>

<p>Greed, ambition, revenge, a desire to reach the gilded
coterie of New York’s <i lang="fr">crème de la crème</i><!-- TN: original reads "créme de la créme" -->, all these
motives Vreeland suspected, but not that an old love,
revived in a burning passion, a mad desire for repossession,
thrilled the hardened heart of the man “who
had once thrown a pearl away, richer than all his
tribe.”</p>

<p>Vreeland was wary and yet uneasy. His heart’s
desire, easily won wealth, now seemed to recede, like
the pot of gold buried beneath the rainbow. He swore
to make no mistake in the impending deal.</p>

<p><a id="png.224" href="#png.224"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>222<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>After a long mental debate, he had decided upon
separate hiding places for the copy and the original of
the one document, which, a two-edged scimetar, gave
him a crushing control, he fondly fancied, over
Alynton, Garston, and also the Lady of Lakemere.</p>

<p>“I must be careful,” he mused. Either of the
men would be a relentless foe, and to him Mrs. Willoughby, now represented only incarnated dollars
and cents. Lucre, not love.</p>

<p>With all his deeply-laid plots, he was baffled at all
points, for his own rooms were still every day deserted
save by the adroit valet.</p>

<p>With tears of rage, Miss Joanna Marble gave up to
him the picture of Romaine Garland, the one visible
token of that young Diana’s existence.</p>

<p>“I have failed, and even the Mansons can get no
trace. I have even sent the picture around among all
the hackmen as far as the Harlem River,” was
Joanna’s meager report. “The girl has simply vanished
and left no trace behind.</p>

<p>“The man who ‘began her past’ for her has probably
spirited the young vixen away. It was a masterly
change of base, for she, sly one, took wing at once on
recognizing that you would like to be something more
than an employer.”</p>

<p>And so, with orders for a redoubled energy in research,
and the hope of a glittering reward, Joanna Marble
returned to her mart of souls and her veiled brokerage
of innocence.</p>

<p>A comprehensive business letter from Mrs. Elaine
Willoughby had at last directed Mr. Harold Vreeland
to relieve Horton Wyman as general supervisor of the
firm. The veiled steel hand under the velvet glove
was concealed there.</p>

<p><a id="png.225" href="#png.225"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>223<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“You will have ample assistance in Noel Endicott
and Maitland. Your partner needs a few weeks’ rest.
Anything private will, of course, be communicated to
you by Judge Endicott. I shall await my own delayed
recovery, and perhaps, a fortnight at Lakemere may
restore me.</p>

<p>“Of course, as I shall keep Miss Kelly with me,
there will be no business transacted uptown. I only
depend upon you now for a daily watch during business
hours of the firm’s affairs. As Noel Endicott has been
made a Stock Exchange member, he will handle the
Board matters, and you will hear my orders from Judge
Endicott through him.”</p>

<p>The letter was curt, chilling, and still courteous. It
was however a polite closing of the social doors of the
Circassia, and the anxious Vreeland, by a prompt
evening call, soon verified the fact of the temporary
absence of the woman who seemed to easily escape his
toils. There was no one at his rooms to handle the
concealed wires now.</p>

<p>And Justine Duprez, too, had been snapped away
out of his sight by the unannounced departure of her
mistress. He was helpless now to continue any
effective espionage.</p>

<p>Even Helms, the janitor, mournfully shook his head.
“The wires are all silent,” he grumbled. “The mail,
too, all now goes direct to Lakemere, and so I’ve
nothing to tell you.” But he wanted a handsome
“temporary loan” just as usual.</p>

<p>A lurid ray of warning light soon gleamed upon
Vreeland’s path in a letter brought by Dr. Alberg from
the beleaguered Frenchwoman. It was only a scrawl,
but a scrawl of unmistakably grave import.</p>

<p>“There is danger hovering near, <i lang="fr">mon amant</i>,” she
<a id="png.226" href="#png.226"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>224<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>warned. “The old judge, the newspaper man, and
his ugly, raw-boned sister have all been here, with the
Kelly, little green-eyed Irish devil, and the other girl,
the pretty one, who was her assistant with you.</p>

<p>“<em lang="fr">Dieu!</em> how handsome that woman is. But they are
all gone away now save the old judge, who comes every
day, going back at night, and the Kelly woman, who
goes home Saturday night. The other girl went away
at night with the two Conyers. Watch the Kelly. She
may come down to your office to spy. I fear that
Madame has already missed the paper. Remember,
we must stand and fall together, you and I. If I ever
find that dark-eyed beauty near you, some dark night,
look out for a dash of vitriol in her pretty face. That’s
all. You would not dare to punish me! I will have no
rivals! <em>You belong to me now!</em>” Vreeland groaned in
his helpless rage.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland’s heart beat wildly as Senator
Garston, after locking the door, drew two chairs into
the middle of the room. He studied the young man’s
face and said slowly:</p>

<p>“Vreeland, I am now in a position to make a fortune
for you. I can easily see that you depend on Mrs. Willoughby in some way. I want you to take a few
moments to consider whether you will not put yourself
unreservedly into my hands, and so, in helping me,
help yourself. You know what the favor of rich
women finally amounts to. The day that the wind
blows cold you are left out in the street. But I can
put you ‘on velvet.’ Now, don’t speak too quickly.
It is a very serious matter. You and I can work
like men together, with no change of heart.”</p>

<p>“What do you wish of me?” guardedly demanded
Vreeland. “It must be nothing inimical to
<a id="png.227" href="#png.227"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>225<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Mrs. Willoughby’s stock interests. I am no babbler, and
no traitor.”</p>

<p>“Your character is perfectly safe in my hands,” half
sneered Garston. “I merely want you to help me, and
make your own future, while not injuring your lovely
employer.</p>

<p>“I know already, through Alynton, that you’re only
a figurehead in the firm, and, by the way, he is pushing
that nephew of his right in as fast as he can, between
you and Mrs. Willoughby. He does not like you. A
touch of jealousy.” The chance shot told, and it
cut Vreeland to the quick. Garston smiled sardonically.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland’s face was livid with rage as the
strong man calmly gazed into his eyes and said: “If
you have ever nourished the idea of managing Elaine
Willoughby, you can dismiss it. The lady is some
years your senior, and moreover, there may be prior
claims. A man like you, with your present standing
and possible future, should only mate with someone
like Katharine Norreys. The maternal tinge to a
marriage with an elder woman is not the thing for a
man of your marked gifts, your position, and your
career. You can do better. The afternoon sun of life
has little real warmth in it. Be warned in time.”</p>

<p>Vreeland sprang to his feet. “It seems that you are
taking an unwarrantable liberty,” he hotly protested.
He had now dropped the waiting game—but he had
fallen into able hands.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” calmly replied the Senator-elect. “You
will be left out in the street in three months if you let
the cold-hearted Alynton dominate that woman’s
changing mind. He wishes to marry her <em>himself</em>. I
say that he shall not! Now, you see, our game is the
<a id="png.228" href="#png.228"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>226<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>same. He has already enough power to displace you—for
reasons entirely beyond your control.”</p>

<p>The words “Sugar syndicate” leaped to Vreeland’s
pale lips, but he mastered himself. “Tell me the
truth. Give me the whole game. Show me where you
can secure me—and then I am your man. But I will
not be paid off with fairy tales.” James Garston
laughed easily.</p>

<p>“I am a good paymaster, and I’ve already learned
my cue. Nothing for nothing in New York. I would
never dare to trifle with a wideawake man like you,”
and then Vreeland bowed and smiled.</p>

<p>“Then, what must I do for you?” demanded Vreeland,
who was now thoroughly off his guard.</p>

<p>The Senator studied his man carefully. “I think
that I’ll trust you,” he slowly said. Standing before
his would-be dupe he said, carelessly. “I had supposed
that you knew that Mrs. Willoughby was still
bound in a marriage which would make all your season’s
work ‘love’s labor lost.’”</p>

<p>The secret was out at last!</p>

<p>Vreeland’s eyes were downcast. He tried to guard
his tell-tale face.</p>

<p>“And has a daughter now old enough to be a more
fitting wife to you than even that Indian-summer
beauty—the mother,” remorselessly continued the
Senator, as Vreeland sprang to his feet in a torment.</p>

<p>“Now, I want you to find that daughter for me—and
if you do, your fortune is made.” He quietly added:
“You see the presence of that girl would spoil the
Alynton marriage, and Elaine Willoughby has only a
heart of stone. She has merely drawn Alynton on by
an assumed resistance. My lady has played her cards
<a id="png.229" href="#png.229"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>227<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>well. I want to find the girl—and break off that match—for
business reasons.”</p>

<p>The flood of burning jealousy which swept over
Vreeland’s mind now washed away the last vestige of
his calculating prudence. Alynton should never have
the Lady of Lakemere.</p>

<p>For a moment a torturing, haunting resemblance was
strangely made plain to him. And now he would hunt
down that lost lamb which had escaped both himself
and that thirsty she-wolf, Joanna Marble. There was
a double motive for the chase now.</p>

<p>“Is that the girl whom you are searching for?” suddenly
exclaimed the excited broker, as he thrust
Romaine Garland’s picture before the gaze of the
astonished Western millionaire.</p>

<p>There was a cry—an echo of the buried past surging
now from Garston’s breast. The echo of a love long
dead.</p>

<p>“By God! It is Margaret herself—at eighteen. Tell
me—tell me—where did you get this?” He had seized
Vreeland by both hands and the picture lay between
them, smiling up at the excited men from the wine-stained
table.</p>

<p>Vreeland bitterly thought of the vacant chair in his
luxurious den—the chair that Romaine Garland had
quitted forever. He began to see that plainly which as
hitherto had only glimmered “as in a glass darkly.”
And for a second time, Fate had dealt him a heavy
blow. She had escaped him as scathless as the “Lady
of the Red Rose.” He had a foothold left, however.</p>

<p>“That is my secret, sir,” sharply said Vreeland, as
he wrenched himself loose, and pocketed the photograph
sent “for inspection to Miss Marble.”</p>

<p>“And that secret is for sale to you, on fair conditions.”</p>

<p><a id="png.230" href="#png.230"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>228<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Let us make instant terms, Vreeland,” cried
Garston, dropping into a chair. He was eager now.
He reached out for a glass of cognac.</p>

<p>“Your game is mine—and mine is yours. If you
find that girl for me I’ll make your fortune—I swear it.
I’ll put you into the strongest secret circle in America.</p>

<p>“You shall handle all my private affairs—but I must
have a gage of your fidelity—even when I’ve paid the
price.”</p>

<p>He watched the breathless schemer, who faltered:
“And that is, when you marry Katharine Norreys there
will be no secrets between us. You shall have money
now—but to open all the doors even to you of the
‘Illuminati,’ you must be mine in interest—forever.”
And then they opened their hearts to each other for
the lust of gold, revenge and power.</p>

<p>The stars were low in the west before the two wary
adversaries had chaffered along to a reasonable basis of
bargain and sale.</p>

<p>“To-morrow—I ask only till to-morrow to think all
over,” was the truce which parted them. And so each
knew no more of the other’s heart secrets at the last
than those impulsive outbreaks of Nature which will
not down. But they had drifted very near on life’s sea.
There were the wildest dreams of a brilliant future
thronging Vreeland’s brain as he left the Millionaires’
Club to find Dr. Hugo Alberg in his midnight haunt
where the Kegelbahn—beer of the stoutest Munich
brew, and the songs of the Vaterland invited the
Teuton to these cheap luxuries, recalling his happy
student days. Vreeland soon caught his gloomy bird.</p>

<p>Vreeland quickly led the startled Doctor aside. He
handed over to him five one-hundred-dollar bills.
“Get out of here by the first morning train. Make any
<a id="png.231" href="#png.231"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>229<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>professional excuse. Find out who is up at Lakemere
with your patient, and, from Justine you must get me
the whereabouts of that dark-haired girl who worked
for me. The pretty one that you saw in my room—Miss
Romaine Garland.”</p>

<p>“I will be waiting for you at your rooms on your
return—and, bid Justine not to dare to write or send a
message save by you. There is the devil to pay somewhere!”</p>

<p>Neither Senator Garston nor Harold Vreeland were
to be found on the busy Saturday which dawned upon
them. For Vreeland, telegraphing down to the office
that he was called out of town for the half-holiday,
closeted himself with a downtown detective firm.</p>

<p>Long before the hour for Alberg’s return, Vreeland
knew that Hugh Conyers was absent at New Orleans,
on a mission for the “Clarion,” and that his art-loving
sister had accompanied him, en route to Colorado
Springs, for the rest of the raw spring season. Their
dainty little apartment was closed and locked.</p>

<p>There were thus two dangerous enemies out of the
way.</p>

<p>At five o’clock the travel-wearied Dr. Alberg
returned with his budget of news.</p>

<p>“There has been a devil of a scene up at Lakemere,”
growled the Teuton. “I found my handsome vixen of
a patient in a decidedly healthy rage. This Senator
Garston came up on a train an hour later than mine.</p>

<p>“There was a violent quarrel between him and our
patroness. Justine could only linger near enough to
hear loud voices, and soon, Garston dashed away as
madly as if the Wild Huntsman was after him. Now,
our one friend bids me tell you that Sara Conyers has
really gone West on business for Mrs. Willoughby.</p>

<p><a id="png.232" href="#png.232"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>230<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“The pretty fraulein has vanished, too—but she is in
some plot. The night before the Conyers woman left,
the three sat up nearly the whole night. Justine would
have followed this girl, but she can not manage to be
even a moment out of the mistress’ sight. And old
Endicott comes and goes every day. Justine hates the
very shadow of the Garland woman, for Madame has
taken one of her sudden fits of fancying a new face—you
know how that lasts,” growled Alberg.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland sought out Senator Garston, whom
he found at dinner, with the sparkling California
beauty at his side. A few whispers were exchanged,
and then, an appointment was soon made. Garston
gave no sign to the young man that he had listened that
day to a defiance unto death. “He is a liar, too,”
mused Vreeland, and yet, for all this, he forgot, too, to
even mention that he had been out of town.</p>

<p>And yet, gazing into Katharine Norreys’ inviting
eyes, as he bade her adieu, Vreeland found that part
of his “purchase price” to be wonderfully fair.</p>

<p>“I could go easily through life with her, backed by a
senatorial ‘push,’ and plenty of money.</p>

<p>“But I will have it all secured. The money all paid
down first. Garston then becomes my real employer.
In this ominous drift, I must change ships at sea—always
a risky business, but yet the bold-hearted Perry
won laurels and immortality thereby. And yet, this
man may be tricking me.” Vreeland, after cogitation,
realized that Garston had not actually lied, but he had
prudently held back the truth. “I suppose that he is
holding the old secret of her early life over her.</p>

<p>“Who the dickens was the missing man? This girl
must have had a father. And that father hailed Elaine
Willoughby as ‘Margaret’ in her heyday.<!-- TN: superfluous " removed --></p>

<p><a id="png.233" href="#png.233"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>231<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I suppose this cold, granite-hearted upstart has
blackmailed his way into the secret pool of the ‘sweetness
and light.’</p>

<p>“Sugar and Oil is a most profitable amorphous
mixture.</p>

<p>“And he would now like to block Alynton’s little
game—and so to be free to hold the past over this
wonder-working woman’s head.”</p>

<p>“Senator Garston,” cried Vreeland, “you may yet
find that love will not be led in chains. Of all hells on
earth, the embrace of an unwilling woman is the
coldest revenge of an outraged Nature. And he
should beware of Elaine—if she can, she will strike
back at him like a wounded lioness.</p>

<p>“And for my own safety there is but one rule, ‘Cash
down on the delivery of goods.’</p>

<p>“And so far, he only proposes partial payments—with
Katharine Norreys as our mutual gage of faith to
the last.”</p>

<p>Agnostic as he was, Vreeland was forced to admit
that Garston’s disclosure of Mrs. Willoughby’s marital
chains had swept away his last hope of ever being the
master of Lakemere.</p>

<p>She was still the wife of some unknown John Doe—and
Vreeland knew that Garston would never babble.</p>

<p>The young broker was ready now to play his last card
to make his position between the two enemies impregnable.
He was again at Life’s crossroads. But he
had a last little game to play out before a final decision.</p>

<p>He was the picture of elegant prosperity as he picked
his way up the long stairs of the modest apartment on
a side street where the humble Kelly family gazed from
a four-story window upon a row of private stables
opposite.</p>

<p><a id="png.234" href="#png.234"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>232<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The hour was opportune, and his own coupé awaited
him below. The hands of the little clock marked nine
as Vreeland raised his hat to the white-haired old Irish
mother seated there, prayer-book in hand, and giving
a touch of dignity to the plain little “parlor.”</p>

<p>The keen-eyed young schemer quickly noted the
photograph of Miss Romaine Garland proudly given
the place of honor upon the mantel.</p>

<p>Before he could announce his errand, Miss Mary
Kelly painfully limped in from the other room, whence
a murmur of voices had told him of her presence. If
he could only trap her into revealing Romaine’s
address!</p>

<p>All his gentle gravity of manner was manifest as
Vreeland explained his personal call. “I desire to send
to Miss Garland her uncollected monthly salary, and
also to obtain some private papers which must be yet
in her possession,” began Vreeland, carefully studying
the girl’s plaintive pale face.</p>

<p>“If you would kindly give me Miss Garland’s present
address, I can send a messenger to her. She probably
forgot the papers.”</p>

<p>Vreeland paused, and then his heart hardened, as the
young girl’s fearless eyes looked him through and
through.</p>

<p>There was an indictment in her innocent glances
which made him mutter, “Miss Majesty has surely
blabbed about the Ollie Manson musicale. That was a
clumsy failure.”</p>

<p>“I cannot give you Miss Garland’s address, Mr. Vreeland,” said the girl, with an uneasy glance at her
old mother.</p>

<p>“She has left New York City for good, and I think
has gone to California.”</p>

<p><a id="png.235" href="#png.235"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>233<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“When she said ‘good-by’ to me, she mentioned that
she would not care to continue as the only woman
worker in your employ. I presume that you will hear
from her through Miss Marble’s agency.”</p>

<p>Vreeland’s quick wit told him that here was “no
thoroughfare.” And all his mean suspicions had been
strengthened by Joanna Marble’s world-worn innuendoes.
His lips curled in an unmanly sneer. “Ah,
yes! I think I shall write to Miss Marble, and now
inform her of the young woman’s dishonorable discharge.
I can, of course, send her salary to the
agency, and as for my papers, I presume that they went
to California with her ‘character.’ Respectable young
women are usually not ashamed to own their residence.
Did she tell you this up at Lakemere?”</p>

<p>His voice was cutting and insulting in its brutal sneer.</p>

<p>The frightened semi-cripple was struggling to her
feet to leave the room, when a brawny, blue-coated
young giant dashed through the still opened door.</p>

<p>He seized Vreeland’s wrist with an iron clutch and
twisted him around before the startled young girl, while
the old mother’s hands went up in a pious appeal.
There was the hatred of hell on Vreeland’s face as he
struggled in that vise-like grip.</p>

<p>“Forbear, Dan Daly! Remember that he’s under
our roof,” the aged widow cried.</p>

<p>The young roundsman fixed a truculent glance
upon the astonished Vreeland. “Apologize, both to
the present and absent, you great hulking coward,”
he cried. “If it were not for my blue coat, I’d throw
you down stairs. And now get out the way you came.
Be quick, too, about it!”</p>

<p>With a mumbled apology, crestfallen and raging at
heart, Vreeland sneaked down stairs.<!-- TN: original has comma --></p>

<p><a id="png.236" href="#png.236"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>234<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I was a fool to get into this low Irish nest,” he
growled, as he sprang into his coupé.</p>

<p>When safely back at the “Elmleaf” he reviewed
the whole situation. “There’s a cold plant here!
That woman has never left this town. I think
that I’ll work the wires to Colorado Springs, and
the detectives can handle California for me.”</p>

<p>He went out to a gay little late supper, not realizing
that Dan Daly the Roundsman had just sworn a mighty
oath to “keep his eye” on the elegant member of the
“Swell Mob,” and all Daly’s oaths were sworn to for
love’s sweet sake, and were doubly iron clad.</p>

<p>It was with a shiver of impending fear that Vreeland,
pausing at a cigar store on Herald Square, accidentally
overheard the night chatter of two late newspaper
Bohemians: “I always thought Hugh Conyers was not
a marrying man, but it seems that he is a quiet, sneaking
lover after all.”</p>

<p>“Down at Philadelphia the other day I saw him put
his sister, Sara, on board a State line boat for Europe,
and the prettiest young woman I ever saw, a staving-looking
brunette, was with the old maid artist. Hugh
was mighty affectionate, too, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“Liars and deceivers all,” raged Vreeland. “But
I’ve got their whole game now. They have run her
over to Europe. I can find her there easily.”</p>

<p>He went home, triumphant in his future plans, little
dreaming that Mrs. Elaine Willoughby had called
Justine to her bedside at Lakemere a half an hour
before. “I have been robbed, and robbed here, in my
own house,” the lady sternly said. “You alone know
of the paper hidden in my corset. Explain at once.”</p>

<p class="chaphead">MINE AND COUNTERMINE.</p>


<p>The mistress of Lakemere was frozen into a forced
calm as she keenly eyed Justine Duprez standing with
open-eyed astonishment before the woman whose heart
was still racked with the sharp battle with Garston.
But Justine’s heart was tranquil. The nurse was far
away over the seas now.</p>

<p>The one man living who knew the vital secret of her
life had thrown off his mask in the bitter conflict of
the afternoon.</p>

<p>“If you will not bring me into your life again,
Margaret,” he cried, “I swear that I will fight my
way to that child’s side, and she shall know how
your cold pride is throttling a father’s honest love.
It has been a hard life, the lonely one I’ve led.</p>

<p>“And to that child’s side, I will yet win my way.</p>

<p>“Remember, Alynton and his friends must listen to
me. I can crush you.</p>

<p>“The walls of your flimsy social fortification will
fall around you at my touch. Tell me, where have
you hidden our child—your child, Margaret Cranstoun!
My child!” And a new fear had entered into the
mother’s soul, all bereft of a husband’s love.</p>

<p>The Senator’s appeal was the hoarse, pleading cry
of a last despair, and in it were the echoes of the last
agony of a desperate man. There before him, still
defiant, stood the wife of his youth, glowing in her
autumn beauty, and at the last, madly desired by the
revenge of an outraged love.</p>

<p><a id="png.238" href="#png.238"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>236<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>All the triumphs of his life were only Dead Sea fruit,
apples of Sodom. For he knew that the proud, silent
lips before him might tell the story of a father’s
shame to that unknown girl whose lovely face now
haunted him. The girl whose picture still rested on
the heart of the yet unbought Vreeland. For the
schemer had carefully reclaimed his property.</p>

<p>“The past is sealed. You shall never hear her call
you father. Mine she is forever, brought forth in tears,
nurtured in sorrow and mine alone,” defiantly cried
Elaine. “I have bought my freedom, with all these
long and lonely years, and it is Nature’s revolt against
the recreated passion of your youth.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she sternly said, “had you found me
poor, faded, broken, in obscurity, would you have
then begged to atone?” She faced him like a tigress.</p>

<p>His quivering lips refused to lie, but he drew
nearer to her menacingly. “Stand off!” she panted.
“Your ownership is forfeit. The brute tyranny of
marriage as made by man; you can not reforge the
chain I wore once. Every fiber of my flesh revolts
against your touch. And she—the pure, the innocent,
you shall never see. I swear it!” He had thus raged
at her side in brutal menaces.</p>

<p>“I go now to Alynton. They shall know whom
they trust with secrets that would shake a nation,” the
passion-blinded man growled, forgetting that he had
dropped to the mere bully. But the victorious woman
laughed him to scorn.</p>

<p>“I hold them, you and your masters, in the hollow of
my hand,” the defiant woman said. “At bay, a true
woman fears nothing. Your ruin and public shame
await you. I will deal with them alone.” And so he
had failed.</p>

<p><a id="png.239" href="#png.239"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>237<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>When James Garston was gone, his mad thoughts
goading him on to the final purchase of Vreeland as the
seal of his revenge, the exhausted woman had sought
her room. “I must telegraph for Judge Endicott,”
she muttered. “This paper must be placed where
neither murder nor millions can reach it.” She slowly
examined the dangerous envelope, and then her
stricken heart stopped beating as the blank paper
fluttered down at her feet. Gone—when—where—how?
A thousand times she had felt it there resting
on a heart now thrilled with a loving hunger for the
beautiful girl who was far away over the yeasty
Atlantic surges, with the one woman whom she could
trust in life and death, Sara Conyers.</p>

<p>She had hardly felt the clasp of her daughter’s loving
arms before fate sundered them. Fate and fear had
parted them.</p>

<p>Her mind was working with lightning rapidity as
she awaited the stubborn French maid’s answer. In an
instant she revolved the whole circle of her friends and
foes. Who was the thief? Justine’s calm voice recalled
her to the troubles of the moment. “I have never seen
it since I sewed it in for you at the Arlington Hotel.
Madame does not doubt me, I hope. Have any of the
jewels in my custody been stolen or your money?
When did Madame discover the loss?”</p>

<p>Under the clairvoyance of suspicion, Elaine realized
the unmistakable air of the <i lang="fr">déclassée</i><!-- TN: original reads "declasée" -->, in the woman’s
crafty face and the physical abandon of her tell-tale
bearing. And yet, she felt that Justine was technically
innocent.</p>

<p>Secure in a nearness to her generous employer, Justine
Duprez had lately given herself over to all the
easy luxuries of a vicious life, and the unerring record
<a id="png.240" href="#png.240"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>238<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was now written on her smug face. There was all the
insolence of the woman’s vile nature shining in her
velvety eyes—the servant ready to turn and rend her
mistress.</p>

<p>“Here is a possible enemy, a spy, the willing tool of
others,” mused Elaine Willoughby, as she rose and
coldly said, “The matter is merely an annoyance,
not a loss. I however wish to be always able to
trust those around me.” In her own mind she
quickly recalled the last time when she had verified
the existence of the document which bound up
a financial secret of national importance. It was
on the day before the dinner at which James Garston
had come back into her life as a living legacy
of a dead past. The existence of the paper had
been verified then, in view of possible “business.”
“When had it been stolen?” Her long illness flashed
upon her. There were a hundred chances since then.</p>

<p>“Madame may remember her long illness,” sullenly
said the uneasy Frenchwoman, at last. “There
were two strange women in charge of you, night and
day. I was not responsible for them, the Doctor
brought them here. One of those nurses robbed Dr. Alberg himself later, and then ran away. <em lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</em></p>

<p>“The story was in all the papers. And, <i lang="fr">pardonnez
moi</i>, Madame was out of her mind. The story of that
woman’s theft was a talk of the town. Doctor Alberg
supplied her place from the St. Vincent’s Hospital
service. Did he not tell you? But I am sure that he
never knew that Madame, too, had been robbed. And
these women were in sole charge for a fortnight of all
your effects. They were in the sick-room night and day.
As for me, Madame, my character is my sole capital.”</p>

<p>She laid a bunch of keys upon the night stand. “If
<a id="png.241" href="#png.241"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>239<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Madame will please have some one verify her jewels,
laces and wardrobe, I am ready to depart. I shall see
the French Consul. He will protect me. And I will
remain here, if Madame pleases, until my room and
boxes are searched. To-morrow I go. <i lang="fr">À<!-- TN: original has "A" --> votre
disposition!</i>”</p>

<p>The sly soubrette feared however that she had gone
too far, as her mistress sternly gazed at her with eyes
flashing with indignation. “Take up your keys,
Justine, and go back at once to your room,” she
quietly said. “Send the housekeeper to me.”</p>

<p>In ten minutes, Justine Duprez listened to the quick
galloping of a horse, whirling a coupé away at a breakneck
speed. There was help sent for. Was it to
be the police? She raged in her heart, for there was
no indication of her angry mistress’ intentions.</p>

<p>“Not a word can I send off to warn Vreeland. It is
every one for himself now. And she dare not arrest
me, for all her quiet suspicions. The other women
were in charge. And Vreeland must protect me now.”
Justine felt reasonably safe.</p>

<p>The woman dreamed uneasy dreams, however, that
night, for she had realized in the past days, to her
astonishment, that she had been skillfully kept chained
to her mistress’ side. She knew nothing of the one
darling hope of Elaine Willoughby’s heart, to hide
Miss Romaine Garland forever from the gleam of the
pitiless eyes of the passion-maddened husband of her
youth. And the caution of the secret council of
friends had held her as a hostage indoors.</p>

<p>But Dr. Hugo Alberg was absolutely in the dark
when he reached Lakemere by the earliest morning
train. He marveled at the absence of Justine, when
he awaited the summons of his supposed patient. The
<a id="png.242" href="#png.242"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>240<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>woman, secretly frightened more every moment at her
long isolation from her only protector, was on duty,
charged with carefully examining every article of her
mistress’ wardrobe, and searching all the rooms where
the invalid had been despoiled by parties unknown.
She became bolder, for as yet, they had not dared
to arrest her.</p>

<p>Through the opened doors of the anteroom, Justine
Duprez could see the flushed face of the greedy German
doctor as he conversed in a low tone with the
woman whose every faculty was now on the alert. It
was an hour of drawn out agony to her before the doctor
hastened away, and from her window, Justine could
see him being rapidly driven back to the station. And
still her mistress was sternly silent.</p>

<p>That evening the household at Lakemere was reinforced
by a detective in plain clothes, who publicly
assembled every inmate of the mansion house and
questioned them all, for some hours, upon every movement
of the two nurses who had been in charge of
their mistress. A shadow of suspicion brooded over
the whole <i lang="fr">ménage<!-- TN: original reads "mènage" --></i> now. Justine Duprez was now
conscious of a burning gnawing at her heart.</p>

<p>For, all day the pale-faced cripple, Mary Kelly, had
been working with flying fingers at the side of Mrs. Willoughby, and the rattle of the key and the clang of
the telephone bell was unceasing. The Frenchwoman’s
nerves were shaken with the suspense.</p>

<p>“Vreeland is powerless here,” mused the frightened
Frenchwoman. “He forgot in his haste to tap the
wires from Lakemere to the old Judge’s office,
and so, all harm can be done to us now. We are
only digging in the dark. We have no defense
<a id="png.243" href="#png.243"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>241<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>whatever. We are cut off from each other. This house
is really a prison for me now.”</p>

<p>The easy swing of Justine’s debonnair insolence
would have moderated had she known that a detective
promptly met Doctor Hugo Alberg at the Forty-second
Street Station; that Mary Kelly’s schoolboy brother
had orders not to lose sight of Vreeland in his daily
wanderings, until relieved by the night detective; that
the “Circassia,” too, was being watched night and day,
and that even Senator James Garston was now provided
with an invisible escort. For, Elaine Willoughby was
fighting for life and love now, to the death.</p>

<p>While Justine was held an unwilling listener to the
detective’s cross-examinations at Lakemere, Judge
Hiram Endicott was closeted below in a grave conference
with Mrs. Willoughby, whereat Roundsman Dan
Daly, looking sheepish enough in mufti, watched the
pale-faced Mary Kelly’s slender fingers recording in
shorthand all the directions of the silver-haired lawyer.</p>

<p>It was midnight before the entire domestic force at
Lakemere were allowed to separate, after volunteering
an examination of all their rooms and luggage. They
knew not what had been stolen, but a vague distrust of
each other was now written on all their sullen faces.</p>

<p>“This forces me to volunteer to do the same, and
so, cuts off my lawsuit for damages,” snarled Justine,
as she descended to find the rooms of her wearied
mistress in darkness.</p>

<p>The hastily summoned counselors had departed to
New York, without the Frenchwoman even learning
of their identity. And now, in her loneliness, Justine
Duprez became the prey to a sudden fear.</p>

<p>In the silence of the night she conjured up visions
of a condign punishment reaching only herself. Her
<a id="png.244" href="#png.244"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>242<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>fellow-conspirator, her ignoble lover! If he could
only be warned.</p>

<p>It was one o’clock when she stole out into the silent
gardens dreaming around the mansion. It was a
desperate plan, but it would warn her lover and
accomplice. If she could only reach the village!</p>

<p>But it was two miles to the railroad station. Once
there however, a French restaurateur, who was her
slave, could send a dispatch to the old hag in charge
of her rooms on South Fifth Avenue. She could
even send a messenger boy down to warn Vreeland.
And the letter which explained the dangers
now threatening them all was hidden in her bosom,
ready for the mail, and inclosed under cover to
the old woman. The little haunt at the station
was open all night for the trainsmen and freight
handlers—a sort of all-night caravansera.</p>

<p>And she knew she could trust Pierre Gervais. A throb
of guilty pride stirred her bosom. He was her easily
subjugated slave, and her countryman.</p>

<p>Young, alert and active, the two miles of country
road was nothing to the hardy Parisienne, child of the
<i lang="fr">trottoirs</i>. Her hand was already upon the latch of the
nearest gate, as a dark form glided to her side. She
was trapped!</p>

<p>“Rather late for a walk, Mademoiselle,” quietly
remarked the detective, who had stolen after her
noiselessly. “You must beware of the night air. It is
treacherous.” In a sullen silence, Justine Duprez
returned to the house. “Here is where you went out;
I guess that you know the way back,” the detective
meaningly said, as he resumed his steady tramp around
the house. And the baffled woman slunk upstairs in a
silent wrath.</p>

<p><a id="png.245" href="#png.245"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>243<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Safe in her room, Justine Duprez hastened to burn
the letter which now weighed upon her breast with a
crushing weight. “My God! If it had been daylight
and they had searched me! Then, the prison cell
would have received me.” With chattering teeth she
crept to a corner, and, unlocking her trunk, took a
deep draught from the brandy bottle. She eyed herself
in the glass. Her face was the very image of guilt.
Its mien was that of a hunted woman. “There will
soon be trouble for others now,” she defiantly said.
“The only story that will save me from prison for this
attempt is the lame one of a lover in the village. <em lang="fr">Va
banc!</em> I have lost my place anyway; my character can
follow it. This cool woman below is not deceived.
They have cut all our wires. I am to be dogged to
death here, day by day. But they can prove absolutely
nothing as to the cursed paper. And my character is
just as good as before.”</p>

<p>She laughed a defiant laugh and hummed a bar of a
song from La Perichole. “<i lang="fr">O mon cher amant, je te jure,
que je t’aime de tout mon coeur.</i> He has to shield me—to
support me now,” she cheerfully concluded, as the
strong cognac cheered her, “for he is in my power, and
Alberg, too; and that sly boots, August Helms also.
They dare not abandon poor Justine. At the last I
confess, and save myself, for my money is all safe
in Paris. Perhaps the Madame would pay me well;
who knows?”</p>

<p>With profound astonishment, Justine Duprez saw the
next day glide by without reproach of any kind. Her
mistress had resumed her normal calm, and beyond a
formal search of the whole house, the matter of the
robbery was left in <i lang="la">statu quo</i>.</p>

<p>Even when Mrs. Willoughby, at night, directed her
<a id="png.246" href="#png.246"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>244<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to pack all her immediate belongings for an instant
return to New York City, there was no mention of that
intercepted nocturnal visit to the station so skillfully
planned. It looked as if the storm was blowing over.
The household had regained its normal calm.</p>

<p>The telegraph and telephone wires were voiceless
and but one ominous cloud lingered over the woman
whose personal belongings had passed a most triumphant
inspection. She was not able to evade the sight
of the keen-eyed cripple or of her mistress, for even
ten minutes.</p>

<p>And the cat-like nature of the woman rightly warned
her of a coming storm. It was impossible for her
the next day, on their departure, to reach her faithful
dupe, Pierre Gervais, for even a moment at the
station.</p>

<p>“Remember, Justine, to watch over my jewels,” said
her mistress, calmly. “Miss Kelly and yourself must not
separate for a moment. I hold you both responsible
for them.” And Justine knew the faith of Mary Kelly
but too well.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I am to be arrested on our arrival in
New York,” gloomily mused the woman, who now felt
herself entrapped. But her spirits rose as she realized
that once in the “Circassia” there would probably
be a visit from Harold Vreeland himself, at once.
“If I can only see him, warn him, then we are safe,
for he will shield me,” she exulted.</p>

<p>And Dr. Alberg, with August Helms, too, would be
under her control. Then it would be an easy matter
to thoroughly forewarn the man to whom alone she
looked now for safety.</p>

<p>With true Gallic prevision, her secretly stolen hoard
of the seven long years past, as well as Vreeland’s
<a id="png.247" href="#png.247"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>245<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>bribes, was now all safely deposited in her own name
in Paris, and she could gaily laugh at the wolf at the
door. For there were also the two nurses between her
and a conviction.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she exulted, “I can snap my fingers at them,
and say ‘<i lang="fr">Bon jour, M’sieur Loup! Comment ça va.</i>’”</p>

<p>The only thing now was to comfortably reach Paris.
For she knew that even across the sea she could draw
upon Harold Vreeland’s golden hoard. “He may even
come over there, to me, at Paris, and I can finish plucking
him there.” With a demure sleekness, she plumed
herself and closely watched the inscrutable face of her
beautiful mistress. Justine well knew the awkwardness
of a mistress daring to arrest her confidential maid.
There was, however, a perfect serenity lingering upon
the noble lines of the human mask which now baffled
even the velvety-eyed Justine, even though her wits
were sharpened by her fears.</p>

<p>In the period since the discovery of the abstraction
of the vastly important document, Elaine Willoughby
had been fortified with Judge Endicott’s calm counsels.
She knew, too, that she was surrounded with friends,
lynx-eyed and active, and that her emissaries were in
the enemy’s camp.</p>

<p>It had only taken Endicott ten minutes to give her a
list of her probable friends and foes. “The whole
thing proves that you were known to be lulled into
the idea that your precious deposit was still there. No
one would dare to threaten or blackmail you and produce
that paper; it is too risky. It would land all the gang
into Sing Sing at once.” He recounted all those
whom its possession could possibly benefit. “There
is Garston, a rugged egoist, and a cool-headed, middle-aged
possible wooer. A man who would confidently
<a id="png.248" href="#png.248"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>246<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>pit his money and place against Alynton, even though
younger and a thousand times his superior in any
woman’s eyes.”</p>

<p>Elaine Willoughby listened in a hushed relief, for,
as fond woman often does, she had only told her aged
Mentor half the truth. She had merely hinted at Garston’s
growing infatuation. “There is Vreeland, whom
I thoroughly detest, and think him at heart capable of
any sneaking villainy. Moreover, Noel also thinks so.
Your generous fancies have cost you dearly in the past,
in your easily volunteered faith. Separately or
together this dangerous document would benefit
Garston and Vreeland.</p>

<p>“Now, mark me. Garston would use it, of course,
only to bring you to his arms. You would hear of it
from him only, for that purpose only.”</p>

<p>“And Vreeland?” tremblingly demanded his client.</p>

<p>“Would blackmail you for a fortune if you ever fell
in his power. I hate his sleek ways, his insincere eyes,
his cat-like moves.</p>

<p>“Minor enemies are Alberg and your French maid.
This German doctor shall not have sole charge of your
health again. His explanation about the nurse is a
very lame one. Of course, you can not pin him down,
for he refuges himself behind an ignorance of your
loss, and points to her flight and the hubbub in the
papers and the police records.</p>

<p>“Of course, you were too ill to be bothered, and so
you may have been despoiled by either the maid or
one or both of the nurses.</p>

<p>“Justine alone knew where the document was; she
has been only the agent of some one of the three; perhaps
of all. A rich widow’s doctor too may be her nearest
foe. Why in God’s name did you not have a
<a id="png.249" href="#png.249"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>247<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>reputable family physician? In your easy seclusion you
thought yourself safe.</p>

<p>“Now go away, and leave them all to me. All
depends upon your absolute unconcern, and leaving
them to me. The rats will come together as soon as
you are out of the way.”</p>

<p>When Hiram Endicott said adieu, it was with a last
injunction to Elaine not to use either the telegraph or
telephone in her absence. “The fact is, my dear child,
if you had married some good man instead of dallying
along with these discoveries, you would now be
proof against all such attacks.”</p>

<p>The grumbling old Judge thought of a golden-hearted,
manly lover whose secret he had unwittingly
surprised, and sighed when he was on his homeward
way. “Given to a woman for her choice, a sly knave,
a handsome fool, and a man really worthy of her, she
will try either of the first two before ever thinking of
the noble heart under her feet. The experience of
every other woman seems to be merely thrown away.
It is the song of the Pied Piper of Hamelin over
again.”</p>

<p>The old lawyer swore a deep oath in his rage. “If
I can not protect her against the weaknesses of her
own heart, I will at least punish some of these banded
rascals. For they will soon fall into my trap.”</p>

<p>To the astonishment of the mystified Justine Duprez,
there was a new butler on duty in the “Circassia,” a
man whose cold and piercing eyes made her tremble.
And also a deft-handed, middle-aged American woman,
whose husband, an extra servant, was evidently cast
for “responsible duties.” And she could not divine
the meaning of all this, but she was tied down to her
lonely rack.</p>

<p><a id="png.250" href="#png.250"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>248<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>The long day dragged away—a day of imprisonment
and one of isolation. There was no visit of the ardent-eyed
Vreeland, that envy of all rising men! And
Doctor Hugo Alberg, too, was conspicuously absent.</p>

<p>The Parisienne felt the toils closing around her, as
her mistress called her to her side before dinner. But
the “Madame” was perfectly unmoved.</p>

<p>“I am leaving here for some weeks, Justine,” she
carelessly said. “All your duties in my absence will
be to continue to search this entire apartment with
Miss Kelly for the paper, which I may have mislaid.
Miss Kelly, who will remain here, will have entire
charge in my name, and I expect you to remain here
with her. You will thus have ample time to make a
most careful search, and very likely you will find the
paper, only a mere formal legal document.”</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman gasped: “Of course, I am free
to go out as I wish?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Justine,” was her mistress’ reply. “But
always with Miss Kelly, as she may need you to help
her at any moment. I leave her as my representative.”</p>

<p>The ashen pallor of fear tinged Justine Duprez’s
cheeks, as she bowed in silence. “They know all,
and I—I—must hold Vreeland now, between myself
and the prison door.” Her mistress’ easy politeness
gave no ground for mutiny or quarrel.</p>

<p>The frightened maid knew not whither her mistress
had departed when the “Circassia” was deserted
that evening by both the new body servants and the
Lady of Lakemere. Their use as a bodyguard was all
too evident.</p>

<p>But the resolute, pale-faced stenographer was
on duty there and ready to enter upon her new
<a id="png.251" href="#png.251"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>249<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>kingdom. There was but one forlorn hope left to
Justine—a hurried visit to August Helms, and to send
the janitor down to the Elmleaf with a message to
Harold Vreeland. She had not left the building, and
her little absence was unnoted.</p>

<p>“Tell him that I must see him at once on a matter
of life and death, and that he must come to your
rooms and wait there to meet me. It is the only
way, and he must come without a moment’s delay, for
all our sakes! Go!”</p>

<p>The stolid German janitor smiled over the ten-dollar
bill, which he pocketed, and after an hour’s waiting at
the Elmleaf, learned from the parchment-faced Bagley
that Mr. Harold Vreeland was dining at the Savoy
with Senator Garston and Miss Norreys. A grand,
private “swell function,” and so, likely to be a late one.</p>

<p>“I’ll give him your message,” obligingly said Mr. Vreeland’s man. “I ’ave always to wait up for him,
you know. He has to be undressed by me. So, I am
sure to see him.”</p>

<p>Helms was anxious to get away and sample the good
“Münchner Leist-brau” in his brother-in-law’s saloon
near by, and so he yielded up his story with a sly wink.
“Fine girl, that Justine. They are all the same—these
pretty French maids.”</p>

<p>When he lumbered away, he did not realize that
Judge Hiram Endicott had received the message
before the triumphant Harold Vreeland had returned,
flushed with both love and wine. The blundering
janitor had played into the enemy’s hands, and Bagley
had easily earned a heavy reward.</p>

<p>Before Vreeland sat in hiding the next morning,
awaiting Justine in Helms’ rooms at the “Circassia,”
Hugh Conyers handed a cipher dispatch to Mrs. Elaine
<a id="png.252" href="#png.252"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>250<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Willoughby at Washington, on her way to Asheville,
in the far North Carolinian<!-- TN: original reads "Carolinan" --> hills. “There is the
missing link, Madame,” said Conyers. “Vreeland and
your maid have jointly robbed you. This vulgar
janitor is only their tool and paid go-between. Doctor
Alberg and Vreeland were shut up together for some
hours yesterday, and you will find that the janitor has
probably robbed your private letters in their interest.
I’ll wire now to Officer Dan Daly, and have him
watched day and night. He is only a beer-sodden
fool. But we will just let them go on, and drop one
by one, into the trap. You will later find Garston
lurking behind it all. I think I begin to see his little
game. Somehow, I distrust that man,” and he murmured,
semi-unconsciously, as he gazed at the agitated
woman beside him:</p>

<p>“Your lonely life has made you an easy prey heretofore
to both schemer and fortune-hunter. You will
have now Romaine to guard, and you need help. You
can not go on and brave society’s natural curiosity.</p>

<p>“And, no half explanations will do. When we have
recovered your missing document, you must abandon
forever all your operations in the Street, and go away
to some safe European land, either Sweden, Switzerland
or Germany, and, moreover, under a good guard.</p>

<p>“If you stay here, you need a resolute man at your
side, one who knows all your enemies, and one who
can protect you. It is the revenge of Nature’s laws.
You can not be father and mother both to your beautiful
Cinderella—God bless her!”</p>

<p>“And do you think that my friends are in any
danger over the loss of the stolen document?” tremblingly
said Elaine, fixing her eyes fondly upon his
earnest face.</p>

<p><a id="png.253" href="#png.253"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>251<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“No,” said the journalist. “There has been time
already to have struck at them. The paper is only
held to coerce you—either to gain over your hand in
marriage, or else, money will be the price of your
safety.</p>

<p>“If it’s Vreeland, it will be merely money. If it’s
Garston, and far the more dangerous of the two—a
man not foolish enough for criminal blackmailing
threats—then he wants to control both you and
Romaine.</p>

<p>“Of course, he has no claim whatever on Romaine.
He would only use her as the pivot to turn your heart
toward him.”</p>

<p>Elaine Willoughby’s eyes were filled with sudden
tears. “If I only dared to tell you all!” she murmured.</p>

<p>But as their hands met, Hugh Conyers brokenly
said: “I am yours to the death; I can wait for your
words, Elaine. Romaine is safe under a watchful
guardian. Roper was an old Wells-Fargo shotgun
messenger; a trusted Pinkerton man later, and as
Romaine is Sara’s roommate, and as Roper never
leaves them by day, you and I can wait here without
fear till the demand is made on you.</p>

<p>“And then, you may find the two men whom I
fear turn up together. But the very moment they
take any steps that indicate the possession of the
document, the tables are turned.</p>

<p>“They are then in our power. And Bagley may
further trap Vreeland.”</p>

<p>“He may have sold his secret to Senator Garston,”
faltered Elaine Willoughby. “The only man on earth
whom I fear.”</p>

<p>“Fear nothing, however, while I am at your side,
<a id="png.254" href="#png.254"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>252<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>and Endicott is our Blucher in reserve. Our fears are
always more real than our hopes,” said Conyers, as
he relapsed into a brown study. He feared a self-betrayal.</p>

<p>The winsome woman at his side was gazing at him
with a new and tender light in her eyes. “How noble
he is! How true!” she sighed; for Hugh Conyers’
friendship was a rock in the desert of her life.</p>

<p>It was after four that afternoon when Harold Vreeland,
plainly dressed, sauntered into the rear entrance
of the “Circassia,” and sought the rooms of August
Helms, the janitor. He was only waiting for the
final sale of a soul and to hear the full story of Justine.
The cold relegation to his routine duties at the office,
and Mrs. Willoughby’s message, had now cut off all
hopes of a nearer social approach.</p>

<p>“I must be very careful,” he mused. “These
fellows down here are all on the watch; and if Elaine
abandons me, I am half stranded with my winter’s
extravagance and, my poor fifteen thousand dollars
will not go very far. But, Garston counsels me to
keep cool, to play my old game, and to post him.
He must now give me his open aid, and Elaine may
not then dare to thrust me out.</p>

<p>“And if I married Katharine Norreys, that would be
the fairest reason for a transference into Senator
Garston’s camp.</p>

<p>“He must give me his entire business in stocks.”</p>

<p>He had quietly dropped into his old business routine,
and the waxen mask of his face was unruffled even
before Wyman and Noel Endicott, his foes in ambush.
He had in some dim way realized that Elaine Willoughby
had only used him as a lever to crush the dead favorite,
Hathorn. And he began now to fear her variable nature.</p>

<p><a id="png.255" href="#png.255"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>253<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I do not dare to accuse her,” he growled, “for
Alida’s visits were a treason to my trust. Does she
know of them?” He breathed freer at the rumors of
the approaching marriage of the golden-hearted Potter
with the woman who was his natural mate. “That
will keep her mouth shut forever, for her own sake!”
meanly exulted Vreeland.</p>

<p>When Justine glided into the dark back room of the
janitor, her excited lover cut short all tenderness.</p>

<p>“Tell me, for God’s sake, all you know! We can
make an appointment for South Fifth Avenue afterwards.”</p>

<p>He had brought a roll of crisp bills to stimulate
Justine’s memory, and when he slipped away half an
hour later, his heart was throbbing wildly. He was
armed at all points now.</p>

<p>In his mean egoism, he saw the storm lowering only
over Justine’s head. “Bah! they will merely chase her
over to Paris; a few thousand will close her mouth
there.</p>

<p>“And I can surely afford it, when I marry Katharine
Norreys, a millionairess <i lang="la">in posse</i>!”</p>

<p>He went directly to the Savoy Hotel, after sending
up a beautiful corbeille of flowers. His mind was made
up at last. “Justine is all right. She dare not talk.
And they will seal her lips and send her out of
America.” He laughed lightly. “My capricious
employer! You are only playing my game for me.
For I should not care to have Justine Duprez as a
bridesmaid. It will be well to have her out of the way.
Garston might use his sly arts on her.”</p>

<p>Lulled by his mean selfishness he forgot all his own
risks, in believing the now half-desperate maid to be
the single object of suspicion.</p>

<p><a id="png.256" href="#png.256"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>254<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>He little knew that the police were quietly watching
every movement of himself, Doctor Alberg and the
now fretful Justine. The cool body servant, Bagley,
was a spy by night and day; and even janitor August
Helms and the two letter-carriers at the “Circassia”
were under the surveillance of roundsman Dan Daly’s
friends in plain clothes.</p>

<p>A minute mark on every letter and a special time
list enabled Miss Mary Kelly, self-possessed and
untiring, to compare daily her list with the chief clerk
of Station Z.</p>

<p>An average detention of two hours on every letter,
and the use of prepared decoys, told of the unfaithfulness
of the janitor and the collusion of the unfortunate
Mulholland, who had succumbed to the demands of a
thirst beyond his salary. For the other letter-carrier
had vindicated himself, and aided to trap his fellow.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland was now ready for his final bargain
with the stony-faced Senator James Garston. He had
withdrawn himself from general society, and, as
envious swains said, was “making the running” now
on Miss Katharine VanDyke Norreys.</p>

<p>The tall, blonde beauty’s exquisite grace, her superb
dress, her Western free-lance wit, and all the brilliant
glow of her youthful freshness, accentuated the charms
of golden hair and the almost pleading violet eyes <i lang="fr">à
l’Imperatrice Eugenie<!-- TN: original reads "Eugenue" --></i>.</p>

<p>Once or twice Vreeland fancied that he had discerned
a tenderness beyond their relations in her manner to
Senator Garston, but his whole faculties were now
devoted to the arrangement of his dual future relations.</p>

<p>“I can easily get my price from Mrs. Willoughby—the
price of her peace—and I might find a way to discover
and return the dangerous paper.</p>

<p><a id="png.257" href="#png.257"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>255<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“A voyage to London, hunting down Martha Wilmot,
and then, a return of the paper to her as a conquering
hero.” In fact, the custody of the paper now
became a source of daily worry to him. He dared not
give it to any other. He feared to deposit it in any
bank of the city or in a safety vault.</p>

<p>“I am king over Justine while I have it,” he mused,
“and to convey it about me is a fearful risk. If I
leave it in hiding, a house may burn, and there is
always the unexpected to fear. If I should fall ill—”
He began to grow morbidly cowardly.</p>

<p>He was lulled by Elaine Willoughby’s silence as to
her loss. “Of course,” he reflected, “Doctor Alberg,
the two nurses and Justine were the only ones who
had access to her during the illness following Garston’s
sudden appearance. I am a ‘rank outsider’ in all that.”</p>

<p>It was clear to him that the Lady of Lakemere had
accepted Doctor Alberg’s ingeniously contrived
explanation as to Martha Wilmot’s robbery. But the
paper—the paper! What to do with it now?</p>

<p>In fact, Judge Hiram Endicott, after a long examination
of the newspapers and police records, had
finally dismissed the frightened German physician
with the remark: “I suppose that this sly adventuress
of a nurse thought her patient had concealed
some bank bills or stocks in that womanly hiding
place, the corset, and has undoubtedly destroyed the
private papers, which were of no value to any one but
the owner.” The able old lawyer calmed the frightened
doctor’s all too evident fear of losing his “star” patient.</p>

<p>Those same private papers, the original and the
copy, had been already shifted by Harold Vreeland,
from time to time, through a dozen different hiding
places.</p>

<p><a id="png.258" href="#png.258"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>256<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Damn them!” he growled. “If I burn them, I am
safe, but then I lose my hold on Elaine. If I sell
them to Senator Garston, I am in his hands as a criminal,
and forever in his power. I’ll make my bargain with
him, and then, cover over my breach with Mrs. Willoughby
by a well-devised return. If she would only
give me a sign of her real purposes!” He was in a
quandary, and had no counsel.</p>

<p>He never knew that Hugh Conyers wrote the long
and even unusually friendly letter from Asheville, in
which his patroness announced her intention of a long
voyage “for a complete rest and change of air.”</p>

<p>A tour, perhaps, around the world via Japan, but he
did know that he was to assist Noel Endicott and
his cool partner, Wyman, in the routine business.</p>

<p>“Stocks appear to be standing on a dead level,” she
wrote, “and so, I will lose nothing in my absence.”</p>

<p>The clear intimation that he would receive fifteen
thousand dollars a year for his services, and that the
“Elmleaf” apartment would be kept up as an extra
account, satisfied him.</p>

<p>“It will be unnecessary for you to write to me for
orders. I may go on from here,” the letter concluded;
“and you will receive all my final wishes later, through
Judge Endicott, by the hands of Noel. Miss Kelly, in
charge at the ‘Circassia,’ will liquidate all the ‘Elmleaf’
bills as usual, through Bagley. I shall close up
both my rooms at the ‘Circassia’ and Lakemere.
Please acknowledge the receipt of this to my Asheville
address.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! She is a cool hand!” cried Vreeland.
“The Colorado Springs humbug and the southern

for a substantial consideration. I am safe, and, I can
easily hoodwink her.”</p>

<p class="chaphead">A WEDDING IN HIGH LIFE.</p>


<p>It was a week later when two alert-minded men
faced each other over a table in Senator James
Garston’s private rooms at the Plaza Hotel. No single
thread of the tangle had been successfully followed up
by the restless Vreeland, save that Mr. Hugh Conyers,
gravely occupied in his usual duties, had returned to
the office of the <cite>Daily Clarion</cite>.</p>

<p>And of the whereabouts of Mrs. Elaine Willoughby,
Vreeland knew absolutely nothing, save that in a stolen
interview with Justine Duprez he learned that Miss
Mary Kelly, now aided by her brother and mother as
inmates, was the caretaker of the superb “Circassia”
apartment. And so, Justine had a new mistress, pro
tem.</p>

<p>The private secretary had handed to the French maid
a note from her absent mistress, bidding her remain on
duty at the “Circassia” until her own return. “Miss
Kelly represents me; she will pay you and give you
her orders, carrying out my directions to her.” And
Justine dared not break away.</p>

<p>There was joy now in Justine’s anxious heart, for
the stolen interviews at her old rooms in South Fifth
Avenue, perhaps, could be soon renewed, Miss Kelly
generously allowing the maid all her usual outings.</p>

<p>And Vreeland had soon calmed the Parisienne’s
growing fears.</p>

<p>“She must however know no more of my affairs now,”
<a id="png.261" href="#png.261"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>259<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>mused the young broker. “She will be useless to me
in the future game, as Fate has dealt the cards.”</p>

<p>But he knew he might have some further use for
her, to watch the promoted amanuensis and to learn
of Mrs. Willoughby’s<!-- TN: final s missing --> movements.</p>

<p>“Yes, she must continue to intercept the letters.
Thank Heaven, I can always depend upon the janitor
and Mulholland!” was Vreeland’s flattering consolation
to his soul.</p>

<p>“It is the only way to trace Mrs. Willoughby’s real
movements and so be able to post Senator Garston.”</p>

<p>He would have been disturbed had he marked
roundsman Dan Daly, a cool but shadowy pursuer of
Justine Duprez on her every outing, and known also
that the untiring schoolboy brother was on his own
trail all the while.</p>

<p>The moving into the South Fifth Avenue lodging-house
of a very agreeable old French crony gave a
neighbor to Justine’s resident old hag, who speedily
became a familiar visitor. And then through the walls
of that adjoining room, a carefully contrived peep-hole
enabled roundsman Daly’s all-seeing eye to witness
the now infrequent interviews of Vreeland and Justine.</p>

<p>“I shall not be happy until I place the jewelry on
that scoundrel’s wrists,” was Daly’s pledge to his own
heart, for he had not forgotten Vreeland—bully and
coward! There was a growing score to settle—a long
one!</p>

<p>And so Vreeland and Justine had freely met in the
fancied security of their Fools’ Paradise.</p>

<p>But blissfully ignorant, over the wine, Vreeland in
the crowning interview, eyed the Western rising
statesman. He was all on the alert as he said: “Senator
Garston, I am now ready to close with you.</p>

<p><a id="png.262" href="#png.262"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>260<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“But first, you must plainly tell me all. Why do
you wish to find this girl?”</p>

<p>Garston carelessly knocked the ash off his cigar, as
he coolly said: “There is a large amount of Western
property, a very large one, in which that child has an
interest, an interest moreover of which she knows
nothing. That is my real business with the girl, whose
life story I alone know—save the mother who has
adroitly hidden her so long. You see her presence
would have embarrassed the social queen!”</p>

<p>“Who was her father?” flatly demanded Vreeland.</p>

<p>The Senator’s eyes hardened. “That is nobody’s
business but mine.<!-- TN: original has superfluous cosing quote --> It does not enter into our affair.
And the property interests demand my present silence.”</p>

<p>Vreeland shrugged his shoulders, and smiling,
calmly said: “You wish me, then, to play my part
openly for you, while I am kept in the dark?”</p>

<p>And Garston steadily replied: “What matters it to
you, if you are well paid?” His voice was steady, but
there was a wolfish anxiety in his eyes. “My professional
secrets could not aid you.”</p>

<p>“My price will be a high one, and cash down or
secured. Either cash or stocks. Sugar stocks will
do,” meaningly replied Vreeland.</p>

<p>“Damn it, don’t haggle!” cried Garston. “Tell me
simply what you want.”</p>

<p>Vreeland calmly pushed over a piece of paper on
which he had written six figures. “I want that, and
then, I will marry Katharine Norreys on your pledge
of honor that you give to her an equal amount as
dowry. You are then to direct the whole future
game. Of course, there must be the usual preliminary
society flurry over the engagement. I am now ready
<a id="png.263" href="#png.263"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>261<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to go over to you, body and soul. What do you say?
I serve you to the death, then.”</p>

<p>“And I am to own you, out and out. You are to keep
near her and to work my will,” demanded Garston. His
voice was strangely eager, for his struggling heart
would have its voice.</p>

<p>“To the death,” answered Vreeland, “if you pay me
first, and then stand by Katharine and myself. It
will be a union of heart, hands and interest.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it on one sole condition,” replied Garston.</p>

<p>“And that is?” eagerly said Vreeland.</p>

<p>“That you clearly understand that your life would
be the forfeit of any treachery. I must reach that girl.
I am playing a game to the bitter end. And you do
not know what a foe that sleek woman can be.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the young man, extending his
hand. “The future will show you what I am. We
must take the risks together.”</p>

<p>“I will give you half in cash, the balance in stocks,
and I’ll hand the check for the cash over now,” said
Garston, as he laid his revolver on the table.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, let me see that girl’s picture. Tell me
where she is, and I’ll sign the check.”</p>

<p>His eyes were wolfish as Vreeland silently handed
him the photograph of the girl who had never known
a father’s love. The young man began his cool recital:</p>

<p>“The girl sailed from Philadelphia for Europe three
weeks ago on the steamer ‘Excelsior,’ under the
assumed name of Alice Montgomery, with Sara Conyers,
the artist sister of the <cite>Clarion’s</cite> sub-editor, Hugh
Conyers. She was hidden away here in New York
under the name of Romaine Garland, and old
Endicott, Conyers and the sister have smuggled the
girl quietly away from Lakemere. The two women
<a id="png.264" href="#png.264"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>262<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>are now at the ‘Hotel Royal Victoria’ at Lucerne, and
Hugh Conyers and Endicott are watching every move
that you make.”</p>

<p>A ferocious gleam lit up the Senator’s eyes. He
signed the check and passed it over to Vreeland. “I
can handle both of them easily,” he growled.</p>

<p>“Tell me the whole story now,” he said, leaning
back with an air of exquisite delight. “My money
will do the rest. I’ll get to her easy enough.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to work quickly then,” answered Vreeland,
“for Elaine Willoughby has stolen away on an
ostensible trip around the world via Japan, but really
to meet the girl and her train. There was a private
guard who went with the two women. My detective
recognized him, and the bodyguard is a cool and
dangerous man, too.” The Senator’s brow was
blackened with a ferocious scowl.</p>

<p>“Damnation, she is clever,” cried Garston. “I
wanted the daughter in this country, for I can not
quickly use foreign laws, and any open violence, of
course, would be madness. Tell me the whole story.
I must be at work at once. It is a serious matter; I
must think it over.”</p>

<p>It was midnight when the two men separated, after
drinking a bottle of “Pommery” to the “ensuing happiness.”
Garston’s eyes were at last gleaming with a
triumphant joy. His quick wit suggested the way
out.</p>

<p>“You are to stay quietly on in the enemy’s camp. I
will let her think herself unpursued. Her desire to
hoodwink you is our only salvation; and now I will
prepare Katharine for your visit. Shake hands!
Here’s to your married happiness. You are getting a
pearl of a woman—a woman fit to be a queen.”</p>

<p><a id="png.265" href="#png.265"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>263<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I have made my fortune,” mused Vreeland, as he
wandered back to the “Elmleaf.” “They are both of
them in my power, Garston and Elaine. He shall
never know that Elaine only found the girl by chance.
I will play them off the one against the other.”</p>

<p>But, in the silence of his room that night the wild
words of Alida Hathorn came back to him. Her parting
curse, “I leave it to the future to punish you!” “I
don’t see where the game can break against me,” he
reflected, “I hold four aces!” And so he slept reassured.</p>

<p>He had read in the evening paper the announcement
of the forthcoming engagement of the “well-known
club man and millionaire, Mr. James Potter,
to the charming widow of the late Frederick Hathorn.”
“Newspaper enterprise!” sneered Vreeland. “Well,
marriage seals her lips like many another sister who
has wandered a few steps from the path. I am safe
now.”</p>

<p>So rapid was the march of Senator Garston’s executive
energy that a week later, under the caption of
“Prospective Wedding in High Life,” Vreeland read
the prophetic intimation of his own union with “the
brilliant Western heiress, Miss Katharine VanDyke
Norreys.”</p>

<p>“It is too late to recoil now,” he mused, “for this
engagement will be telegraphed by Conyers over to
my ‘financial backer.’”</p>

<p>The barriers were down, and nightly, under the
guise of the usual preparations, Vreeland and Garston
conspired against the woman whose heart was burning
with all a mother’s still unsatisfied love. The Senator-elect
was using all the mighty resources of his wit, fortune
and hardihood to trap the travelers and to
<a id="png.266" href="#png.266"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>264<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>circumvent the wife who had defied him. And he
wrought in a stern silence.</p>

<p>There was a little scene with Justine Duprez which
was not down on the bills.</p>

<p>And of that scene, roundsman Daly was at once
made aware by the reports of his woman spy, now the
intimate friend of Justine’s old <i lang="fr">garde-chambre</i>.</p>

<p>A common curiosity and the confidences engendered
over the absinthe glass caused the two women
to mark the comings and goings of the handsome
young broker and the lissome French lady’s maid who
had prospered so wonderfully.</p>

<p>For Justine’s hand was an open and a liberal one.
Justine had, after a storm of tears, gone away contented.
In her heart she proposed in the future to secretly
reign over the new <i lang="fr">ménage<!-- TN: original reads "mènage" --></i> of her young tyrant and
dupe.</p>

<p>When Vreeland had at last quieted his rebellious
dupe, he explained to her at once that in the new
household there would always be a commanding position
for herself, should Mrs. Willoughby cast her out
on her return.</p>

<p>“So you see, Justine, I can always protect you, and
then, when you wish to go over and settle in Paris, you
will always have me near you as a protector.”</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland was now perfectly happy, and a
little more than usually self-assertive.</p>

<p>For, on Wall Street all men now envied the man who
was cementing a union which would practically control
the profitable business resulting from Senator Garston’s
vast operations in stocks and mines.</p>

<p>Garston was a financial battleship, and a man of
mark, even on Manhattan’s shores.</p>

<p>“Our policy, Harold,” genially remarked Senator
<a id="png.267" href="#png.267"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>265<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Garston, “is to work right into the enemy’s camp, and
to take no notice of Mrs. Willoughby’s little maneuvers.
I shall open a large active account with your
firm. That gives us the right to be seen together at
all places and times. It will blind them all. And
while I watch Alynton, you can always keep an eye
for me on that crafty young Wyman. Of course, as
soon as you are married, Katharine can note every move
of the woman we fear. Let them lull themselves to
sleep. We will make a strong team, us three!
Katharine shall worm into Mrs. Willoughby’s intimacy.”</p>

<p>And even in the bustling office of Wyman &amp;
Vreeland a deeper respect was soon engendered for
Vreeland’s brilliant, dashing successes. “A Senator
behind him, and with the handsome young heiress as
a wife, he will have fully as much weight as Wyman
backed by his uncle Alynton and the Endicotts,” so
mused the observant cashier.</p>

<p>In fact, Senator Garston’s handlings of Western and
Southern roads, far-away mines, added to the immense
business of his bold strokes in the leading securities.</p>

<p>“There is no good excuse for Alynton, Wyman nor
Mrs. Willoughby pushing you out of the firm as long
as you really handle my business,” said the acute
Garston. “They would have no sufficient business
warrant in so doing, for naturally Alynton and myself
are bound by both party and personal ties, which must
rise above any petty quarrel. I can easily handle
Alynton. He is, of course, the secret business counselor
of Mrs. Willoughby, and as she fears me, and with
reason, she will never strike at you, as long as our pact
holds.</p>

<p>“And then, moreover, your marriage with
<a id="png.268" href="#png.268"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>266<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Katharine Norreys removes every possible social objection
to continuing your supposed confidential relations
with the Queen of the Street. Any kind of a wife
brings you within the ‘safety line.’ Moreover, Mrs. Willoughby is really fond of Katharine, and those
blue eyes of the young lady’s are as keen as a diamond’s
flashes.”</p>

<p>“Will Alynton finally marry this strange woman?”
was Vreeland’s searching query.</p>

<p>The stony-faced Senator-elect sprang to his feet,
livid with rage. And Vreeland marveled as the
angered man harshly cried:</p>

<p>“Never, by God! Impossible! How could he?
There’s that girl—the one whom I’ve sworn to take
away from her. The mother can not explain the presence
of the child to her admirer.</p>

<p>“She dare not! For the Alyntons are all as proud
as Spanish hidalgos, and young Alynton is no fool.
He would have to find out that she had lied to him—that
her whole past life has been a sham—and no man
or woman can ever deceive David Alynton twice. He
is merciless. I’ve been a fellow-director with him for
years, and I know him. I hold them both in the
hollow of my hand.”</p>

<p>The Senator quickly saw that his rage had led him
on too far, for the young man’s eyes were open in
amazement at the passionate outburst.</p>

<p>“There are these property interests,” he grumbled,
“and I suppose she has hoodwinked the girl as to
her rights. It’s the old game. I am the only living
man who can set it straight, and I will do so, in my
own way. I have sworn to do it for my own reasons,
and to even up with My Lady.”</p>

<p>When James Garston went away to direct his secret
<a id="png.269" href="#png.269"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>267<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>agents, now watching Lucerne by its dreaming lake,
and following the steamer “Empress of India,” nearing
Hong Kong, Vreeland tried to pierce the mystery
of Romaine Garland’s nurture.</p>

<p>“Can it be,” he pondered, “that the property which
Elaine enjoys really belongs to that child? That the
young girl was artfully brought up in ignorance of
her rights? Has she been robbed? The young beauty
may have broken away inopportunely, and appeared
here to embarrass the youthful-looking beauty whom
Alynton seems to adore.”</p>

<p>He could see no possible solution of the problem.
“Garston seems to be enraged at the mere idea of
Alynton’s intimate relations. Can it be that a secret
love in olden days has tied the proud Senator to this
wonderful woman? He is dead set against her drifting
into Alynton’s arms.” It was all a life puzzle.</p>

<p>He was ready for the meanest suspicions, but the
observations of Justine dispelled them.</p>

<p>“Only friends; nothing more,” had been the verdict
of a woman who would have gloried to have held her
mistress in the clutches of blackmail.</p>

<p>“And the love of the same woman has now, as usual,
made Alynton and Garston secret foes,” decided Vreeland.</p>

<p>He recalled the legendary source of Mrs. Willoughby’s
tangible fortune, some Western windfall of
vast richness.</p>

<p>“She knew him before, she fears him now, and has
spirited the girl away to keep them apart.”</p>

<p>It seemed clear to Vreeland that some partner, or
old associate, perhaps a client of Garston’s in the
wild West, had owned both the property and the lovely
woman in her flush of girlish beauty.</p>

<p><a id="png.270" href="#png.270"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>268<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“It seems to be an old passion,” mused Vreeland.</p>

<p>“And now repulsed by the mother, whom evidently
he has pursued, Garston would use the girl as a lever
for his revenge. Once a breach effected with Alynton,
and the girl his ally, then the Queen of the Street
would either drift into his arms or have ‘to step down
and out’—to abdicate the crown she has worn so
long.” Vreeland lumbered along, building up fanciful
solutions of the mystery.</p>

<p>In the now almost incessant “duty service” near his
beautiful fiancée<!-- TN: original reads "fiancèe" -->, Vreeland a hundred times endeavored
to trace back James Garston’s early life. But
the blue-eyed Nixie who was soon to be his wife only
laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“Pray remember, sir, that Senator Garston is my
guardian. After my dear father’s death, my mother
went abroad, and I was educated in the ‘Sacré<!-- TN: original reads "Sacre" --> Cœur’
Convent at Brussels. Her death left me alone in the
world.</p>

<p>“‘Uncle James’ had been almost forgotten by me
in the thirteen years which we passed in Paris and
Brussels, and as I left the West a mere child, all my
memories are the vanishing dreams of childhood. All
his social past is a sealed book to me.”</p>

<p>Vreeland was fain to be content, as the lovely
ingenue concluded: “All I know is that he has always
managed my affairs, and that his personal history is
linked with the development of the whole region west
of the Rockies. Why, you should know his history
from your own Western wanderings.”</p>

<p>“Was he ever married?” timidly hazarded Vreeland.
But, the young society queen only laughed back.</p>

<p>“Ask him! And then ponder now the possibility of
another marriage. You are now, sir, to take me
<a id="png.271" href="#png.271"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>269<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>driving. The only marriage which concerns you, is a
joint affair.”</p>

<p>That afternoon, as they drove through the park
under the chaperonage of the amiable Mrs. Volney
McMorris, Vreeland unsuccessfully endeavored to
allay his recent dissatisfaction at the absence of any
womanly background for the highly polished “Western
diamond,” which he was soon to win and wear for life.</p>

<p>The story of the young heiress was smooth enough
and faultlessly delivered. Vreeland forebore to
“pump” Mrs. McMorris, for he was well aware that
she was “all things to all men,” and her voluble
explanations would carry no real conviction.</p>

<p>“She helped Alida Hathorn on to the very verge of
ruin,” he gloomily recalled.</p>

<p>“There might have been a marriage between myself
and Elaine but for her vicious intermeddling.</p>

<p>“She took that Isle of Wight story in commission
and spread it all over New York, while working both
sides for coin—a woman Judas!”</p>

<p>While he returned the salutations of Messrs. Merriman,
Wiltshire and Rutherstone on the social parade,
he was vaguely reflecting on the uselessness of his
crime as regarded the stealing of the hidden paper
and the tapping of the private wires, as well as the
mail frauds.</p>

<p>It now followed him like his own shadow, and the
paper was a source of countless nightmares. If it
were only safe!</p>

<p>“All that is useless now,” he growled. And he
suddenly saw that he was left in the power of Doctor
Hugo Alberg, of Justine and of August Helms, the
janitor.</p>

<p>“There will be no speculation in ‘Sugar’ for months;
<a id="png.272" href="#png.272"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>270<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the market is dead, pending the reorganization and
New Jersey reincorporation.</p>

<p>“My strange employer is away. She will not be
here for months; and she has also taken alarm at the
presence of Garston.</p>

<p>“The whole lot of them will probably operate in a
blind pool now. There will be nothing for me to gain,
and everything to lose in running any further risks.”</p>

<p>He saw with concern that Alberg greatly missed his
wealthy and generous patient, and a few significant
hints had proved to him that the German physician
was now “money hungry.”</p>

<p>“There is Justine always to be pacified, and that
brute, Helms, too; he will surely want money.</p>

<p>“Once married, and a fixture here, I am ‘nailed to
the cross’ for torture by these people—if they should
turn against me.</p>

<p>“Fear will control Doctor Alberg at the last,”
reflected Vreeland. “He has been guilty of half-poisoning
his patient.</p>

<p>“Justine I can surely rely on as long as I keep her pacified,
but, that brute Helms is steadily increasing in his
money demands. Some night, when drunk, he may
blow the whole thing abroad.” And he had caught a
glimpse of Helms and Bagley diving into a saloon
together. It frightened him.</p>

<p>It was true that Helms had found his way down
several times to the Elmleaf to get money, in a half-fawning
and half-threatening bluster.</p>

<p>And on several occasions when Vreeland was absent,
the grave-faced valet, Bagley, had joined the janitor,
and in some hours spent over the cups of Gambrinus
had gained pointers which had given the lively roundsman,
Dan Daly, some very valuable hints.</p>

<p><a id="png.273" href="#png.273"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>271<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>There was in his cup of “bittersweet,” however, one
great consolation to the successful Harold Vreeland,
whom all men now envied.</p>

<p>The impending union with Katharine Norreys would
found his fortunes on a solid basis; he would have the
absolute protection of the great speculative Senator, and
the reports of his detectives told him that Hugh Conyers
was simply buried in his journalistic duties. It
seemed to be a lull in the war, even the pickets had
ceased firing.</p>

<p>There were no conferences with Judge Hiram Endicott,
and nothing to indicate any activity among
Romaine Garland’s friends.</p>

<p>Only one side of the whole affair remained dark to
Vreeland. Even Justine Duprez could not tell him
how or why Elaine Willoughby had openly taken her
unacknowledged daughter to her house for shelter.</p>

<p>It was as yet a mystery as to whether fear, intrigue
or accident had brought the lovely girl into the opened
arms of her still beautiful mother.</p>

<p>“All I know,” said Justine, in a conference arranged
for this purpose by her now indifferent fellow-conspirator,
“all I could find out was, that this green-eyed
cripple, this little sycophant Irelandaise, who now is
my tyrant, brought the tall girl late one evening to
the ‘Circassia.’”</p>

<p>“It was a strange visit,” murmured Justine, “for
she brought no luggage, and that girl never left my
mistress’ presence for a moment, till she went away
with the two Conyers.</p>

<p>“I am certain that Madame had never seen this girl
in the seven years of my employ. There were no
pictures, no relics of childhood—nothing. And I was
<a id="png.274" href="#png.274"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>272<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>always on the lookout for the mystery of Madame’s
<span class="nw">life—”</span></p>

<p>Justine demurely dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>“Bah!” she cried; “a woman with blood as cold as
a fish! No life, no love; she cares for nothing but
money.</p>

<p>“Among all of them, not a lover! I thought she
was fond of the dead Mr. Hathorn once, but he was
soon on a level with the others.”</p>

<p>Justine’s voice was duly scornful.</p>

<p>“And then her tears and frequent fits of sorrow!
That was the record the whole of seven years.</p>

<p>“The last thing I saw of her—a stolen glance—she
had this girl’s picture in her hand, and was weeping
over it.</p>

<p>“If she is a child of hers, she is probably a child
of shame. She now fears the exposure, and has gone
abroad to hide the girl away forever. Trust to Justine’s
experience! I know these women saints. They
always have nibbled at <i lang="fr">le fruit defendu</i>—hypocrites!”</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Vreeland fancied that he saw light at
last. “I believe that I can observe Senator Garston’s
game. He would use this hidden fact to force Elaine
Willoughby into his arms. By Jove! she does fear
him! Perhaps Justine is right.</p>

<p>“And so, when I am married to Katharine, and
Garston is free of all social claims, if he alone knows
her secret, it may be buried forever in her marriage
with him.</p>

<p>“To bring the proper pressure to bear, he must have
the girl first. And he would not be too good to bribe
the girl with a fancied inheritance. Once that the
child is under his influence, Elaine’s proud heart must
either bend or break.</p>

<p><a id="png.275" href="#png.275"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>273<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“For he will win his way to her side, even across
the fires of Alynton’s hate or the social ruin of Elaine’s
good name.” Vreeland already knew the iron will of
the man who was driving ahead with recklessness in
the chase.</p>

<p>And so, armed with the deadly secret of the enormously
powerful cabal, the stolen document, Vreeland
now knew that if brought to bay, Elaine would perhaps
be sacrificed by the secret syndicate, despised by
the undeceived Alynton, and then, with the secret of
her early life in Garston’s possession, be utterly at
his mercy. “Yes, she is in the toils,” he muttered.
“There is no escape for her.”</p>

<p>It was at the wish of Senator James Garston, now
lavishly liberal in his preparations for his ward’s wedding,
that the bridal was postponed to the first days of
June.</p>

<p>“All is going on well, Harold,” said Garston.
“We have worked into a thorough accord with all her
representatives.</p>

<p>“And you will not find love-making with Katharine
Norreys an irksome task. I wish only to wait till I
learn that Elaine Willoughby has landed at Brindisi.</p>

<p>“Somewhere on the Continent she will surely meet
this girl. I shall have instant reports from my detectives.
For so far, we have found out Elaine’s route,
but, the girl is still hidden.</p>

<p>“I wish you to go away at once on your wedding
tour, and then to keep Mrs. Willoughby in sight—within
touch. I only want to meet the mother and
daughter face to face—only once. I will have my
innings then, and finish the whole matter in short
order.” His face was merciless now.</p>

<p>“Now, you will be no object of suspicion on your
<a id="png.276" href="#png.276"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>274<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>wedding tour; such a happy voyage always explains
itself,” he sardonically smiled. “The moment that I
am cabled for, I shall depart incognito. My work will
be quickly done when I find this sly woman and her
child together. The whole world is not wide enough
to hide that child from me.” And Vreeland drifted
daily under Garston’s strong control; he was floating
with the tide, drunken with all his successes.</p>

<p>The days drifted along in all the preoccupation of
daily business and the growing bustle of the impending
wedding.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland was most agreeably surprised in
the later days of May by a cordial letter from Mrs. Willoughby, posted at Port Said. Her congratulations
upon his impending marriage were coupled with her
carte blanche as to leave of absence from the firm,
and the significant direction to leave Bagley in charge
at the Elmleaf.</p>

<p>“We shall have business uses for the apartment
during the winter, and Miss Kelly will give Bagley all
his orders and attend to the accounts. I have directed
Judge Endicott to present in my name to your wife
a proper reminder of the esteem which I have for
her.”</p>

<p>The notification three days before the wedding,
through Noel Endicott, that Mrs. Willoughby had
placed a year’s salary at his personal disposal on the
books of the firm, as an extra bonus, carried away the
last vestige of Vreeland’s haunting fears.</p>

<p>Nothing remained of the awkward episode of the
inquiry as to the stolen document, and Vreeland had
already settled with Doctor Alberg, and Helms with
an affected liberality, for his absence.</p>

<p>Now socially entirely in the hands of Messrs.
<a id="png.277" href="#png.277"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>275<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Wiltshire, Merriman and Rutherstone, his three groomsmen,
and having seen the resplendent Mrs. Volney
McMorris rally many beautiful Ishmaelites, married
and single, around his bride, Vreeland was moved
forward to the altar on the golden flood of Senator
Garston’s splendidly liberal preliminary entertaining.</p>

<p>The Western millionaire was touching up every
cloud hanging over Katharine VanDyke Norreys’<!-- TN: original reads "Norrey’s" -->
social haziness with a golden lining.</p>

<p>There remained but two things for the happy
groom to do now.</p>

<p>The one was to have a last interview with Justine,
who was now reduced to a calm subserviency to the
orders of the young “Private Secretary,” and the other
to effect a safe deposit in some satisfactory place of the
stolen document and its tell-tale copy.</p>

<p>He had decided to be liberal with Justine in money
matters, and to entrust her in his three months’
absence with the watching of Helms, the janitor, and
the disgruntled German doctor.</p>

<p>A famous plan suggested itself! Justine should feed
out to these men money, in his name, during his
absence.</p>

<p>“And that, with the hope of more, will keep them
true to me, as rascals go, till I return.” He had once
decided to dismantle the secret connections with Mrs. Willoughby’s telegraph and telephone. It was the
subject of a long, introspective reverie.</p>

<p>But reflection had told him of a possible mistake.
And perhaps in his absence, Justine might glean
from the detained correspondence delivered at the
“Circassia,” some facts to guide both Senator Garston
and himself. Yes, the “underground railroad” should
<a id="png.278" href="#png.278"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>276<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>not be disturbed. Its existence was as yet concealed
from all his enemies.</p>

<p>The use in the next winter of the “Elmleaf” rooms
for a concealed headquarters of speculation caused
him to leave the wires in position. “It might excite
these people’s suspicions. I must appear to trust
them,” he decided, “and Garston may even make a
million over the private tips I can give him if I am up
to their game.”</p>

<p>Suddenly it occurred to him that his own marriage
might change the situation, and yet, there were Elaine
Willoughby’s recent orders.</p>

<p>“She means probably to hide her child, and then
come back and be Queen of the Street again,” he
smiled. “The ruling passion. She has the speculative
mania still.” For it was clear to him now that
the presence of mother and daughter together in New
York City was an unnecessary risk.</p>

<p>And so, even on the threshold of his marriage Harold
Vreeland feared to trust his bride with the secret of
the stolen document. They were to live at the Hotel
Savoy on their return, “so as to be near Uncle James,
at the Plaza.”</p>

<p>With a moral cowardice which he could not explain,
Vreeland had as yet declined to face the burning
question of the stolen document. The copy he had
always carried secreted within the waistcoat lining of
his traveling suit. “I can easily leave that over in
Europe,” he murmured. “The original. Where
shall I hide it?” He was long in the dark.</p>

<p>But it was by a devilish impulse, aided by accident,
that he found a place in Justine Duprez’s rooms on
South Fifth Avenue to safely hide the dangerous
original.</p>

<p><a id="png.279" href="#png.279"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>277<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>One of the plates of a door framing had sprung
partly loose. A sudden idea seized him. Her rooms
were the safest place for many reasons.</p>

<p>To gain time for preparation, he sent the old hag
away on an errand.</p>

<p>Sealed in a cloth envelope, the paper was soon hidden
behind the upper framing plate, and with a hammer,
covered with his kid gloves, he drove the half-dozen
old, rusted nails tightly home. And he gazed in
triumph at the neat device.</p>

<p>“They will of course think that she stole it, should it
ever be found,” he mused triumphantly, as he lit a
Henry Clay and gloated over his cunning.</p>

<p>“If the house should burn I am safe. In every way
it would go up in flames. If I should die, then it
makes no difference to me what happens. If she is
caught—this would be damning evidence only against
her.</p>

<p>“And I would never dare to trust myself with
either Garston or my wife, and be found out in the
custody of that document.</p>

<p>“Accidents will happen; I might fall ill, and now
no matter what befalls, it never can be traced to me.”</p>

<p>He grinned with joy as he contemplated depositing
the copy abroad, under an assumed name.</p>

<p>“It will there be safe from all American legal process,
and the original is here where I can use it if
needed, and as it is, it can never be traced to me.”</p>

<p>He carefully examined the exterior of the row of
solid brick tenements. They were good for a life of
fifty years.</p>

<p>As he walked away, when he had “finished his letters,”
and left a last greeting for Justine, he stood
upon the heights of an impregnable position.</p>

<p><a id="png.280" href="#png.280"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>278<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“It was a stroke of genius, that last idea of mine!”
he gaily cried, as his eye rested on an old woman
who had just descended the stair. He knew not the
burden of her eager soul. She carried his fate!</p>

<p>Once around the corner, that old woman scuttered
away to find roundsman Dan Daly, for the peep-hole
had covered a keenly-glittering eye, even after Justine
had left her sighing lover to his “last bachelor
letters.” And thus the hiding-place was known to more
than one.</p>

<p>But Vreeland hastened away in a triumphant glow
of satisfaction.</p>

<p>The splendors of the Grace Church wedding, the
gilded festivity of the Waldorf wedding dinner, and
all the countless preoccupations of the impending
voyage busied Harold Vreeland’s excited mind for
three days.</p>

<p>There were hundreds of valuable wedding presents
to deposit in safety, for society had showered gifts
upon the successful interloper with its hard-hearted,
hollow flattery of success. It had been a “society
event,” and his face, with that of the beautiful bride,
had ornamented several “up-to-date” journals.</p>

<p>The flower-decked bridal staterooms of the “Campania”
had received Vreeland’s party, and Messrs.
Rutherstone, Merriman and Wiltshire were joining the
bride and bridesmaids in the parting “loving cup,” the
table was covered with journals filled with the usual
“glowing accounts” and piled up high with congratulatory
letters and telegrams, when “Uncle James”<!-- TN: closing quote invisible -->
drew the complacent bridegroom aside.</p>

<p>In a private nook, he turned a scowling face to the
happy Vreeland.</p>

<p><a id="png.281" href="#png.281"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>279<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>A yellow telegraph envelope fluttered from his hand
to the desk as he read again these disquieting words:</p>

<p>“She has telegraphed for a cabin on the ‘Normandie,’
and is coming home alone. Took a special train from
Vienna to Havre. All traces of girl lost.”</p>

<p>“Vreeland,” growled the maddened man, “some one
has betrayed us. Wait at the Hotel Cecil, London,
for my cipher orders.</p>

<p>“That woman is a devil in artfulness, and it is a
fight to the death now.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, the “Campania” was plowing
down the beautiful bay.</p>

</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h3 title="XIV. For the child’s sake!"
 ><a id="png.282" href="#png.282"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>280<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class="chaphead">FOR THE CHILD’S SAKE!</p>


<p>The crowding passengers lounging on the decks
of the “Campania” and “Normandie” idly watched
the fleeting waves torn up by the ocean racers as they
swept by each other in mid-ocean four days later, but
there were strangely agitated hearts, too, on the passing
steamers, when the signal flags were broken out.</p>

<p>For, the secret enemies now swept past each other
at the distance of a few furlongs.</p>

<p>“What the devil can the real motive of her quick
return be?” angrily mused bridegroom Vreeland, as
he called up again Senator Garston’s baffled fury on
learning that for all his goading on, his detectives
had failed to locate the missing Romaine Garland.</p>

<p>He led his beautiful bride back to her room, and then
left her to the enjoyment of “Les Denis-Vierges,”
while he eyed the fast-receding “Normandie.”</p>

<p>“Another big deal in ‘Sugar,’” he suddenly thought,
and he felt himself perhaps hoodwinked by both Senators
and the handsome woman who had so artfully led
him on to his fate. “It may be that they all are fooling
me; I may have been merely jockeyed away.
Mrs. Willoughby can work the ‘off side’ of her deals
alone from the ‘Elmleaf,’ and the regular transactions
will go on as usual through our firm, really Alynton &amp;
Willoughby. Or, she may have picked up another
protégé. God only knows what a woman may do.</p>

<p>“They all have their secrets, by Jove! Senator
<a id="png.283" href="#png.283"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>281<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Garston or this cool devil, Hugh Conyers, may now
turn up as the secret broker in my place.”<!-- TN: closing quote invisible --></p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to him that the powerful Western
millionaire might really be the favored lover, and
Alynton, after all, only the dupe of a growing passion.
“I am powerless to go further now,” he groaned, as
he gazed at the rooms where his lovely and exacting
bride was “squeezing the orange of life” to its last drop.
He had found out, even now, that there were thorns
upon his rosebud.</p>

<p>He was not yet entirely satisfied with the status of
husband so recently assumed. Still affecting all the
delicacy of the lover, he had, however, quite practically
approached the subject of Katharine Norreys’<!-- TN: original reads "Norrey’s" -->
investments “in the hands of Uncle James.”</p>

<p>And he soon found out that the exquisite form of
his dazzling blonde wife hid a resolute and undaunted
spirit, an unruffled temper, and an easy, natural
defiance of all marital control. “Where did she get
her experience of life?” mused the startled bridegroom.</p>

<p>“You must go over all these tiresome matters,
Harold, with Uncle James, on our return,” the overwearied,
fashionable bride answered.</p>

<p>“I have never entered into any details with him,
and I supposed, of course, that you and he had covered
all this ground. I have only asked him for money as
I needed it since my return, and he has always sent
me his checks. It is for you, both business men, to
regulate such matters.” And she cast her eyes down
again on her entrancing book.</p>

<p>“Then you have no permanent bank account of your
own?” moodily demanded Vreeland.</p>

<p>“Why should I have one?” innocently replied Mrs. Katharine Vreeland, “when Uncle James has always
<a id="png.284" href="#png.284"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>282<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>paid the bills and furnished me all that I ask? I have
never asked him for any formal accounting.” Harold
Vreeland was secretly nettled at her easy carelessness.</p>

<p>“And if he were to die, if anything happened, you
would then know nothing of your own affairs,” said
the dissatisfied husband.</p>

<p>“No more than I know now of yours, my dear,”
calmly answered Katharine, settling herself deeper in
her cushions. “Uncle James simply told me that you
were a very rich man, and of course, I took his word.
I have not asked you to inventory your own possessions.”</p>

<p>She was turning an unusually interesting leaf as
Vreeland walked out of the cabin in a suppressed
rage.</p>

<p>“We are both at sea, it appears,” was his disquieting
thought, and again the remembrances of that
slender family tree of his lovely wife annoyed him.
It seemed to begin and end in the graves of the dead
parents, who were only gruesome shadows.</p>

<p>“I will go over this whole ugly matter with Garston
at once, just as soon as I see him,” was Vreeland’s
mental decision. “Katharine is either a child-wife of
the Dora order, or else far deeper than the sea that we
are skimming over now.”</p>

<p>It came to him cogently that he had taken her “on
trust” largely, and that a current of life’s mysterious
undertow had swept him along into Senator Garston’s
power. There was no going back, however.</p>

<p>“It is too late to hesitate now,” he mused, as he
uneasily gazed back toward America, well knowing
that some giant game might be played in his absence.</p>

<p>In the deal there would be no cards for him, however
the luck might turn. And there remained but
<a id="png.285" href="#png.285"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>283<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>one golden gleam in the gray clouds. He had that
paper with which to dominate Mrs. Willoughby. But,
it was a dangerous weapon; it might prove a boomerang.</p>

<p>“Justine Duprez stands between me and all harm.
That was a master-stroke! And so I can cut into the
game as I wish, on my return. The very first thing I
shall do will be to get Katharine’s fortune out of
Garston’s control. He shall face the music. And yet,
I can afford no quarrel until that is all safe.”</p>

<p>In the month which followed this vain attempt at
probing the financial resources of the wife of his
bosom, Mr. Harold Vreeland, at the Hotel Cecil, London,
found the beautiful Katharine’s money-spending
power to be something abnormal.</p>

<p>There was a rapid exchange of letters and cable
ciphers between Garston and the young broker spy,
but the husband was never enlightened as to the
nature of the frequent telegrams and letters passing
between “Uncle James” and his ward.</p>

<p>It vastly annoyed him—this continued private
commerce of ideas.</p>

<p>The questions of the husband were frankly enough
met. “I have always been accustomed to do exactly
as I pleased,” the lady remarked, with a bright, hard
smile. Vreeland’s face hardened.</p>

<p>“And now, that you are married?” demanded Vreeland,
angrily.</p>

<p>“I shall continue to do so, Harold,” his wife sweetly
replied.</p>

<p>“If you would have me lead a Darby and Joan life,
please to remember that sort of thing went out with
the ‘Rollo books’ and ‘Faith Gartney’s Girlhood!’”</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Vreeland, the husband of a few weeks,
<a id="png.286" href="#png.286"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>284<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>soon realized that while he was doing the clubs and
music halls of London, his resplendent wife had
quietly gathered up quite a coterie of admiring American
men, generally conversationally lumped as “the
Western gang.”</p>

<p>These ardent cavaliers seemed to be all wifeless,
and, strangely enough too, without mothers or sisters.
“‘Uncle James’ friends,” was Mrs. Vreeland’s saving
clause, when at last her angered husband remonstrated
at their increasing circle. He was beginning to be
agnostic as to her guilelessness.</p>

<p>And on their removal to Paris, where certain of these
“friends” soon after appeared, Katharine Vreeland
bravely continued “to do as she pleased,” and her now
bitter husband partook himself to sparkling wine
and “the sights of Paris.”</p>

<p>He was driven along from day to day, for he had
no reliable news from the seat of war. He realized
that he was alone in the world and without one
trusty friend. His wife was only a bright enigma.</p>

<p>“The lone-hand game has its disadvantages, I
perceive,” was his bitter secret comment, as he tired of
the Hotel Continental—the perfunctory drives in the
Bois, the open summer amusements—and visibly
fretted at his wife’s endless shopping.</p>

<p>Even with Garston’s substantial bribe, he began to
see that Mrs. Katharine Vreeland’s “separate estate”
was to become a very “burning question”—in the
near future.</p>

<p>She was a “money-eater” of the first class.</p>

<p>“Let us get back to New York,” he moodily said
after one of a series of wordy recriminations. “With
all my heart,” placidly retorted the “beautiful Mrs. Vreeland,” for she had now acquired that professional
<a id="png.287" href="#png.287"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>285<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>designation in the journals and the cant phrases of the
uneasy floating “American circle” of Parisian high
life.</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland was now mentally tired of the
by-play of marital fencing. He realized, in all their
varied encounters, that she was calmly superior at
every clash.</p>

<p>Bright, bold and ready, she “came back at him”
every time, and he was quietly cornered by that flashing
rapier, her tongue. What man can prevail against
that two-edged sword?</p>

<p>But one resource was left. He had run the gamut
of sullenness, persuasion, a bit of bullying, some
pleading and even a touch of lofty tenderness, but her
point was carried high, her wrist easy, and her blade
opposed to him at every turn.</p>

<p>He could not avouch himself a mere fortune-hunter,
and so, he took refuge in an ominous and expectant
silence. “I will get hold of her estate, and then curb
her extravagance,” he brooded.</p>

<p>His worst fears as to the “underground railroad”
communications of the “uncle” and ward were realized
when he finally received a positive request of Senator
Garston for an immediate return.</p>

<p>“I want you at once. I wish to lay out our plans for
the winter. And if I am to trap this underhanded,
intrigant Mrs. Willoughby, I must finish my work
before the opening of the session of Congress, and our
committees will begin soon to meet. Come on, with
no delay.” The words were almost mandatory, and
they annoyed him strangely.</p>

<p>Returning from his banker’s with this letter, he
found his wife’s two maids busied in packing up all
her effects. He was startled, but took the defensive.</p>

<p><a id="png.288" href="#png.288"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>286<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Something impelled him to keep the news to himself.
“I am tired of Paris,” shortly said his wife, as she
recognized the drifting odor of an absinthe frappée.
“We can just catch the Gascogne, and so, I have
ordered all my bills sent in. You must attend to them,
and then, secure our passage.”</p>

<p>“Let me know their probable amount,” gruffly
answered the husband, as he departed for the steamer
office. He was beginning to feel a master hand now.</p>

<p>“She had the news before I received it,” he growled.
“And I swear I will make it my pleasing duty to
bring ‘Uncle James’ to book, on my return. I will
get her property into my hands, and control it.</p>

<p>“She would beggar even a Vanderbilt, an Astor or
a Goelet, if given a free hand.” Vreeland aspired to
the conquest of this defiant beauty in rebellion.</p>

<p>It so happened that the game as laid out by “Uncle
James” suited all three; but, while he thirsted to see
Justine Duprez once more and to confer with Doctor
Alberg, Vreeland was really anxious at heart to
re-enter the comparative protection of his Wall Street
office.</p>

<p>“By Jove! I am at least between the lines there,”
he mused. “I can frighten both sides, and so, guard
myself.”</p>

<p>It was on the Gascogne that he watched Katharine
VanDyke Norreys as the Count de Millefleurs (a young
attaché going over on his first appointment) bent over
her steamer chair.</p>

<p>“This marriage has only hung a millstone around
my neck,” he resentfully brooded. “And I wonder
if I was only brought in to relieve ‘Uncle James.’” It
was a mean suspicion, but it clung closely to him.</p>

<p><a id="png.289" href="#png.289"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>287<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>He was now the prey of ugly thoughts, and fleeting
fears disturbed “the sleep of Richard.”</p>

<p>There were times when he feared for the safety of
the document so deftly hidden away. The copy had
been artfully deposited (under receipt) in a Belgian
branch bank in Paris, under an assumed name, and the
banker’s receipt was now sewed in his waistcoat.
“Thank God! That is all safe!” he sighed.</p>

<p>He little reflected that one day, laughing over the
“Agony Column” of the London <cite>Times</cite>, his eye had
paused at the name “Martha Wilmot.” Some
trace of familiarity, some fleeting memory caused him
to read the few lines.</p>

<p>“Handsome reward and the most complete immunity
guaranteed. Greatly to your advantage. Communicate
in any way.”</p>

<p>The signature, “New York,” followed by an
address, closed the expensively placed announcement.</p>

<p>“Some relic of man’s folly and woman’s frailty!”
he laughed. “The old, old game goes on forever.”</p>

<p>And yet, he little dreamed that Hugh Conyers and
handsome Dan Daly were now the right and left hand
men of Judge Hiram Endicott, who was engaged in
some very interesting metropolitan researches.</p>

<p>In far-away New York, there was the veiled duel of
two fearless intellects going on, even in the summer
days, when the town was empty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elaine Willoughby was again the radiant mistress
of Lakemere, although she spent a portion of
her time in town at the Circassia.</p>

<p>There was now a strange glow of happiness shining
on the splendid woman’s face, and the services of
Doctor Hugo Alberg were permanently discontinued.</p>

<p>It was impossible for the revengeful Teuton to
<a id="png.290" href="#png.290"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>288<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>learn the reason from Justine Duprez. The courteous
terms of Mrs. Elaine Willoughby’s letter, inclosing a
check for his annual account, were too unmistakable
to be misconstrued even by the dense German. It
was a <i lang="fr">congé</i><!-- TN: original reads "congè" --> not to be misunderstood. His Waterloo!</p>

<p>And, in a roundabout way he had also learned that
Judge Endicott and his nephew made up the whole
social circle at Lakemere, with Hugh Conyers as a
permanent summer guest.</p>

<p>Hugo Alberg had sworn an oath that Harold Vreeland
should recoup him for the loss of his star patient.
He now only awaited the return of his proposed
victim “to levy the Rhine dues.”</p>

<p>A visit to the South Fifth Avenue rooms where
Justine had vicariously entertained him in the old
days, gave him the news, by the mouth of the old
denizen, that “<i lang="fr">la pauvre</i> Justine” was tied down at
Lakemere.</p>

<p>“Some one have robbed ze lady last year, and now
Justine is ze prissonaire to watch ze garderobe all ze
while; and only ze travail and ze solitude! <em lang="fr">V’la tout!</em>
<i lang="fr">Pauvre</i> Justine! <i lang="fr">Elle vent bien partir pour la France.</i>”
The doctor hungrily awaited Vreeland’s return for a
bleeding process.</p>

<p>No one but the Frenchwoman herself knew how
tightly the coils were wound around her. Shaking in
fear, left without the secret protection of her traitorous
tempter, Vreeland, she dared not try to break
away from Lakemere, for she now feared the gleaming
wrist-irons.</p>

<p>To run away<!-- TN: original reads "way" --> would be only to invite an instant arrest,
and she panted for the time of the winter’s gaieties.
She would have a chance perhaps then to slip away
unknown.</p>

<p><a id="png.291" href="#png.291"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>289<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Her plan was already formulated. A simulated
illness, a last “bleeding” of Harold Vreeland, and
then, a return to dear Paris. Once again on French
soil, she would be safe. For Paris would soon swallow
her up. The vicious child would be hidden in the
mighty bosom of the Mother of all Wickedness.</p>

<p>“Ah! he shall pay,” she muttered, as her velvety
eyes rested, lit up with a strange fire, on the beautiful
woman whose iron hand now held her so firmly.
“She and the Kelly—how I could drive a knife into
their hearts!” she hissed.</p>

<p>“But Justine must wait; gold first, gold—and then
<i lang="fr">la liberté</i> shall be mine.”</p>

<p>When “Harold Vreeland and wife” were duly
domiciled at the Hotel Savoy, he was not astonished
at the proximity of “Uncle James” at the Plaza Hotel;
but, even on the pier, when the Senator met them,
Vreeland noted the ravages of some overmastering
passion in the strong man’s face.</p>

<p>The eyes were brilliant and unsteady, there was a
foreign irritability in his abrupt manner, and Vreeland’s
attempts at a <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> were only met with a
sharp command “to get inside his old business lines”
as soon as he could; and Vreeland, humbled, kept
his temper.</p>

<p>“I must have you back in the traces again,”
sharply cried Garston. “And, I would get up to Lakemere
to-night if I were you. See Mrs. Willoughby,
and get safe on the old basis.</p>

<p>“The stock market is humming, and I will soon have
need of you in Wall Street. I trust no one there but
you.”</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland hastened away to the office, and
found the same unimpassioned greeting which had
<a id="png.292" href="#png.292"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>290<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>always characterized Horton Wyman. And in the rush,
they were now glad to have his aid in their increasing
affairs.</p>

<p>“You will go, of course, up to Lakemere to-night?”
said Noel Endicott. “I have already telegraphed your
arrival to Mrs. Willoughby.”</p>

<p>In a stolen detour, Vreeland arranged for an early
morning interview with Doctor Alberg, and then he
passed the “Circassia” on his way to the train after
dinner.</p>

<p>The flat demand of janitor Helms for “backsheesh”
keenly angered a man already enraged by “Uncle
James’” quiet appropriation of the first evening with
that hawk-eyed free-lance of marital beauty, Mrs. Katharine Vreeland, “whose remarkable loveliness had
created such a London and Paris sensation.”</p>

<p>“I will soon cut the Gordian knot between these
two,” growled Vreeland, as he descended from the
waiting carriage at Lakemere. “I will either have
my wife and her property to myself, or else ‘Uncle
James’ will show his hand, to the very last card.” He
was beginning to be reckless in a blind jealousy.</p>

<p>The welcome of Mrs. Elaine Willoughby to her
returned protégé was merely a complacently cordial
one, and yet, in half an hour, Vreeland bore away the
assurance of lulled suspicions and his continued business
relation.</p>

<p>“I shall soon call upon Mrs. Vreeland and assure
myself by inspection of her married happiness,”
was the last greeting of the hostess, whose other
guests, if any, were invisible.</p>

<p>“I will send for you to the ‘Circassia’ next week,
and give you my general directions for some business
which is impending.”</p>

<p><a id="png.293" href="#png.293"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>291<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“That woman has found a new happiness. Her life
is now complete,” was the keen-eyed schemer’s comment
as he sauntered away toward the park gates,
where the impatient horses awaited his return.</p>

<p>A flitting form in the dusky garden walks led him
toward the “lovers’ labyrinth,” behind the unforgotten
summer house. His one friend was on watch.</p>

<p>“Justine!” he gasped, and he hastened to stealthily
join her in the deepened gloom of the trees. A new
fear smote upon his startled nerves.</p>

<p>There was the velvet-eyed Frenchwoman in waiting,
and her passionate words, her panting breast and
gleaming eyes told him of an unbroken tie, the bond
of their guilty past.</p>

<p>The startled woman fled away at the sound of distant
voices, while Vreeland, wildly agitated at heart,
hastened to his carriage.</p>

<p>“The enemy are on their lines,” he defiantly said.
“I must strike a blow somewhere, for Elaine Willoughby’s
vengeance is not dead, but sleepeth. She
has not been deceived.</p>

<p>“And, Justine is a virtual prisoner. If she were to
tell all!” He stopped short, for his heart bounded in
agony. “I must remove that document,” he muttered.
“For, even she may become an enemy.” He
had always distrusted all men and his marital experience
led him now to distrust all women—even Justine.</p>

<p>As he dashed down the road to the railway station,
Vreeland noted an athletic lad easily following the
springing horses, mounted on a racing bicycle.</p>

<p>The fact that the same lad sauntered into the smoking-room
of the car, and patiently dallied with a cigarette,
never intimated to the unconsciously shadowed
<a id="png.294" href="#png.294"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>292<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>man that the schoolboy follower was tracing out his
every movement.</p>

<p>But, officer Dan Daly smiled victoriously next day
when he heard Mary Kelly’s brother tell of Vreeland’s
brief tryst with Justine, and his long interview with
Doctor Alberg in South Fifth Avenue. “I’ll get him
yet, in the very act,” he cheerfully prophesied, “with
that stolen paper in his hand.”</p>

<p>“The trap is nearly ready to spring,” complacently
reflected the Roundsman, as he ordered a night and
day watch at the peep-hole which controlled the interior
of Justine Duprez’s rooms.</p>

<p>“I have sworn not to marry Mary Kelly till I’ve put
the ornaments on that rascal.” He glanced lovingly at
a pair of spring-steel handcuffs of his own especial
selection. His fancy jewelry!</p>

<p>The days gliding along rapidly as Harold Vreeland
dropped into his old groove of the “automatic business
relations” in Wall Street found him still the victim
of adverse currents, and wavering in the blasts of
contrary-blowing winds. He made no headway
toward a solid footing.</p>

<p>Socially, the return of the Vreelands was an event of
moment, and the tide of unrestrained gaiety rose high
around the now frankly defiant wife. There were
soon those gay cavaliers, Merriman, Wiltshire and
Rutherstone, in attendance, “the Three Guardsmen”
of the defiant young Western queen.</p>

<p>And the ever amiable Mrs. Volney McMorris and a
flock of semi-detached women of the younger married
set gathered to the feast.</p>

<p>“There was racing and chasing on Cannobie lea,”
and the brilliant young matron was soon classed as a
<a id="png.295" href="#png.295"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>293<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“Madame Benoiton,” <i lang="fr">jamais chez elle</i>! And Vreeland
soon followed her example, living also in the open.</p>

<p>In the hotel corridors of the Savoy, the curious
shaven servitors often listened to the sounds of vigorous
marital debate, wherein the low growl of Vreeland
followed the strident soprano of Mrs. Katharine.</p>

<p>For, “Uncle James” had not yet been brought to
book! And the young husband was brutally sullen.</p>

<p>There had been several bitter exchanges of hidden
menaces between the two men at the Hotel Plaza.
“I am fighting the fight of my life, Vreeland, now,
over some great Western properties,” gruffly answered
Senator Garston.</p>

<p>“I’ve no time now to go into Katharine’s affairs.
Ask her; she will tell you that all is right.</p>

<p>“And I am, besides, carrying on a half-arm, in-fighting
duel with that devil of a woman.</p>

<p>“I need you in your place to keep her quiet, and
whether you wish to or not, you shall wait. That’s
all.” The iron fist of the statesman made the glasses
ring in an angry emphasis.</p>

<p>“You had better watch over your wife and keep her
friendly with Mrs. Willoughby than try to budge me.
I need both your help now, and, I propose to have it,”
was Garston’s last shot, as he strode away. Certainly
“Uncle James” did not mince matters.</p>

<p>And as the days drifted on, Vreeland became an
object of remark, even in the hurry of Wall Street.
His wife seemed to be on terms of a frank social intimacy
with the Lady of Lakemere, but the man whom
all had envied was rapidly becoming a profitable
habitué of the Café Savarin. It was the beginning of
the end of the “splendid run of luck.”</p>

<p>The funds received from Senator Garston, his
<a id="png.296" href="#png.296"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>294<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>purchase price, had been seriously depleted by the young
wife’s extravagance, and soon, both roundsman Dan
Daly and the cool Noel Endicott laid before Mrs. Elaine Willoughby the proof of Harold Vreeland’s
heavy outside speculations in the “active stocks.” The
desperate man was “plunging” now blindly.</p>

<p>Both of these secret agents marveled, in their different
interviews, when the Queen of the Street answered
the mute inquiries of their eyes:</p>

<p>“Just let him go on; do nothing whatever to interrupt
him. Only report all to me.” And onward
dashed Vreeland toward unknown reefs of woe.</p>

<p>She knew, too, that a haggard-eyed man often stole
over the walls of Lakemere, like a thief in the night,
now, to meet Justine Duprez, who was just beginning
in her own cowardly heart, to wonder whether a
frank confession might not save her.</p>

<p>For there were no “sure tips” now to aid Harold
Vreeland’s redoubled plunging, and the “strong spirit
of wine” was burning away the brain of the man whose
once handsome face was now distorted with racking
emotions and bloated by cognac. He was on a steep
“down grade.”</p>

<p>“He may kill me!” tremblingly whispered Justine,
who secretly counted up her gains safely stored away
in Paris. “I might tell them all, and then go away
over there. Dare I speak?”</p>

<p>She began to watch, with a sinking heart, the
clear, unflinching eyes of her mistress, now glowing
in all the awakened love of her satisfied motherhood.</p>

<p>“Not yet, not yet, only at the very last!” was the
cowardly woman’s decision, as she crept to the safety
of her room. The French maid’s cowardly terror
escaped not her mistress’ eyes.</p>

<p><a id="png.297" href="#png.297"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>295<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>If she had known that “Martha Wilmot” had
secretly crossed the Atlantic and was now hidden
away under Roundsman Daly’s charge, that news
would have brought Justine at once, a shivering culprit,
to her mistress’ feet. And now, others than Vreeland
were playing a sure and waiting game.</p>

<p>But the downward curve was now slippery under
Harold Vreeland’s uneasy feet. He had thrown off
all his retentive watchfulness, and he even roughly
repulsed Doctor Alberg and Janitor Helms, who
hounded him to the apartments at the Elmleaf, where
the suave Bagley still welcomed his unhappy master.</p>

<p>Brooding there at night after the double life of his
Wall Street duties, and his private plunging, Harold
Vreeland at last formulated a direct demand upon Senator
Garston for money. He stood now on the brink
of personal ruin.</p>

<p>The market had gone sadly against him. Loss on
loss had swept away the great sum which he had
received as a bribe, and his wife’s recurrent extravagance
at last led him to draw the fifteen thousand
dollars of his salary for the current year.</p>

<p>Noel Endicott handed over the check without a
word, and the fact was soon the property of Roundsman
Daly. “I’ll gather him in when that money is
gone,” chuckled Daly. “He is near to the end of his
rope now.”</p>

<p>“I can see the white hand that is throttling him!”
muttered the blunt policeman. “It’s the mistress.
She will soon bring him to his knees, and maybe
there’ll be no work left for me to do,” he said with a
professional sigh of regret. For, he had set his heart
on “running Vreeland in.” “I’ll have him, dead or
alive, yet,” the policeman swore.</p>

<p><a id="png.298" href="#png.298"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>296<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>But sterner than all the blows of Fate was the blunt
rebuff of Senator Garston, when Vreeland, with burning
eyes, demanded a considerable money advance.</p>

<p>“I gave you enough money for four years at least.
You have your own income down there; what the devil
have you done with it?”</p>

<p>The haggard man murmured complaints of his wife’s
extravagance. There was his whole line of privately
held stocks in danger now, and the market was faltering.
The Senator read the truth in his eyes.</p>

<p>“See here, Vreeland!” angrily shouted Garston.
“You’ve been drinking far too much of late. I will
see that your wife has money—for herself, but not for
you. I hear that you are deep in outside speculations.
If so, remember the old remark about a fool and his
money.”</p>

<p>Harold Vreeland turned without a word and left his
secret enemy, now his master. “If I only dared to
use the secret of the document!” he raged, as he sought
the hospitality of valet Bagley at the Elmleaf.</p>

<p>There were days now when he did not go to the
office where the business of “Wyman &amp; Vreeland”
hummed merrily along.</p>

<p>Days, too, when he did not return to Mrs. Katharine
Vreeland’s informal court at the Hotel Savoy.</p>

<p>“If I only dared!” he growled. But then he
reflected that any use of the document would probably
“land him behind the bars.”</p>

<p>He dissembled his rage, as he returned late that night
to the separate apartments he now used at the Savoy.</p>

<p>In the hall, as he lay in a wakeful unrest, he heard
two servants chattering. “The old Senator is here all
the while; I guess he is the real head of the
family.”</p>

<p><a id="png.299" href="#png.299"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>297<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>And then the disgraced husband remembered Alida
Hathorn’s parting malediction: “I leave it to the
future to punish you.”</p>

<p>He arose and sought the brandy bottle with uncertain
steps. For he realized at last that whatever game
the Senator and his wife were playing, he was counted
only a mere pawn. And, the game of Life was going
against him now!</p>

<p>His power had departed from him, and before he
showed his distorted face next day on Wall Street his
line of private stocks was sold out “under the rule,”
and he was really a beggar—stripped of all his ill-gotten
gains, when he returned that night to face his wife,
who, richly dressed for an evening’s outing, passed by
him with a silent sneer. Truly a marriage <i lang="fr">à la mode</i>.
He was at bay now!</p>

<p>Vreeland turned into his own room with a muttered
curse, and after a vicious pull at the brandy bottle,
rushed out upon the streets to wander aimlessly in the
throngs of the night.</p>

<p>For he was chased out by the maddening thoughts
brought to his half-crazed mind by a chance glance at
the <cite>Evening Journal</cite>.</p>

<p>“A social note” of interest heralded the fact that
“Mr. and Mrs. James Potter had returned from
Europe, and that the hospitable VanSittart mansion
on Fifth Avenue would soon be opened to society once
more, as well as the beautiful old colonial manor house
of Oakhurst. This union of two old families has
united hearts as well as millions,” etc.</p>

<p>“By God! I will not live in New York to have her
laugh at my downfall!” swore Vreeland, as he raced
along with his coat opened to the chill autumn air.
The menace of her curse came back: “I leave it to
<a id="png.300" href="#png.300"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>298<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the future to punish you!” And at last, he was a
broken and ruined man—a human wreck.</p>

<p>On this sharp evening of early October, Senator-elect
James Garston sat alone, moodily gazing into the
cheerful wood fire in his sumptuous room at the
Plaza. He watched the bright blaze for an hour,
until the hickory billets had turned into white ashes,
flaking the tiles at his feet.</p>

<p>On the table at his side lay an unfinished letter, and
by the dying embers the man who had the world at
his feet groaned. “Ashes of life! The ashes of a
dead past.”</p>

<p>For, by the side of his last passionate appeal lay one
or two tattered letters traced in a girlish hand.</p>

<p>Garston walked the floor with a strong, resounding
tread, as he went over every detail of the veiled duel
of the last months.</p>

<p>In the glass at either end of the room he saw his
own strong, resolute face, the silvered temples framed
in iron-gray hair, his brow furrowed with the lines of
care which neither his honors nor his millions could
efface.</p>

<p>On the table lay his watch, pocketbook and revolver.
He paused, and picked up the heavy Smith &amp; Wesson
aimlessly. The man who had faced death in a hundred
forms bitterly smiled as the trigger yielded to his
practiced finger. There, he held ready fate in his hand!</p>

<p>“Here is either vengeance or release,” he gloomily
muttered. “If we were to go together.”</p>

<p>And then his face softened. “Not yet! Not yet!”
he murmured. “I shall live to look upon my child’s
face.”</p>

<p>And so, he had honestly cast up the accounts of his life,
not sparing himself. He knew that Elaine Willoughby
<a id="png.301" href="#png.301"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>299<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was now surrounded by an alert body-guard of detectives;
that her volunteer guardians were with her
daily. Either Judge Endicott, his nephew or the
grave-faced Hugh Conyers was always an inmate
of Lakemere on every visit she made to that lonely
spot, and his own detectives had warned him that a
special policeman was also an inmate of her household,
while Roundsman Dan Daly was a grand outside
guard. He dared not approach her. Could he lure
her to his side?</p>

<p>Ignorant of his wife’s secret warfare with Harold
Vreeland, Senator Garston saw in all these precautions
only the confirmation of her stern sentence of
banishment from her presence.</p>

<p>He knew, too, now of the practical victory of her
trip around the world. Elaine Willoughby had made
her word good. The missing girl had simply disappeared!
And he had been unable to reach the girl in
order to blacken the mother. He was powerless now.
All his craft, backed by money, had been met and
vanquished.</p>

<p>When he had paid off all his detectives in a sullen
despair, the Chief of the “Inquiry Bureau” had admiringly
remarked: “Your enemy has certainly handled
herself superbly, Senator.”</p>

<p>“Force is of no use. She has been guided by some
matchless intellect. We easily traced the girl over
to Dresden.</p>

<p>“There she became an inmate of a private Klinik,
which, bowered in gardens and surrounded with stone
walls, is guarded like the Kaiser’s palace.</p>

<p>“Fortified by the stern German laws, the Doctor in
charge would be able to resist anything but a criminal
warrant. He owns the property used by the Klinik.
<a id="png.302" href="#png.302"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>300<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>And so far as we know the two women have never
met. Mrs. Willoughby turned up first in Vienna, but
we lost her at Port Said. God knows where she was
in those two months.</p>

<p>“The girl went into the Klinik and never emerged;
that is our final report. You know what your orders
were—no scandal, no publicity. We tried to get an
agent into the establishment. Ah! Useless! It is a
close corporation.”</p>

<p>The Senator on this lonely night was happy that he
had only divulged to his agents his desire to find the
girl for reasons of an old, bitter intrigue about her
property interests.</p>

<p>Too well he knew that Margaret Cranstoun’s clear
voice, if once lifted to tell the story of his past, would
damn him forever. The toga would then be but a
public badge of shame. And so, fear stayed his strong
hand.</p>

<p>And a hundred vain solutions of the enigma had
haunted his fancy, for he himself felt assured that the
women had met in Europe, and that his daughter was
now lost to him forever.</p>

<p>He groaned as he pondered over the sweet face smiling
up from the dearly bought picture. His sentence of a
living death weighed heavily upon him now. The
daughter whom he yearned for would perhaps never
call him “Father!”</p>

<p>“By Heavens!” he cried, in his anguish. “Margaret
may have the power to hold herself aloof from me.
I have lost all my rights to her. There is the past to
face. She is right as to herself, but, the child!
Nature’s laws, the laws of God and man, give me the
right to a hearing. It is for my child alone to forgive
or to condemn her father. And, I could atone! She
<a id="png.303" href="#png.303"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>301<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>could have all—an honored name, a solid fortune, and
a repentant man’s blessing. ‘Only to hear her voice,
only to see her face,’” and he broke into bitter sobs.
For he dared not deceive his hungry heart. He was
wretched, lonely and repentant.</p>

<p>The wretched man little knew how ably Roper had
fulfilled his trust as personal guard, how wisely Sara
Conyers had concerted her measures.</p>

<p>Secretly smuggled away at night from the Dresden
Klinik, Romaine Garland had been transported to
Copenhagen in a private car, and, on beautiful Lake
Malar, near stately Stockholm, an old chateau, now a
secluded sanitarium, had given its welcome shelter to
the three travelers. Judge Endicott’s all-seeing eye
followed their every movement, and Roper had nobly
upheld his trust.</p>

<p>The heart-hungry mother, hastening from Port Said
to Odessa, and thence to St. Petersburg, had crossed
the Baltic to Stockholm, and then, while the baffled
detectives were still watching in Dresden, had clasped
to her heart the girl whom the lame secretary’s chance
affection had given back to her.</p>

<p>And what a delicious apprenticeship in motherhood
was opened to the loving woman! A fairy heaven!</p>

<p>There, by the blue waves of Lake Malar, the mother
learned of Alva Whiting’s peaceful girlhood days
in western New York. How those who had given her
a home had died leaving her their honest name and a
legacy of love in the technical education which had
fitted her to gain a living. And then, came the ordeal!
The pathway of a maidenly Una among the lions
and jackals of Greater New York City.</p>

<p>And in God’s mystic providence, the strange path
which had led her to the temptations of the great
<a id="png.304" href="#png.304"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>302<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>restless city was made only a return to the bosom of
the woman who had lost her child in the shifting of
the mock philanthropic “Home.” And how fondly the
happy mother clung to her wonderfully restored lost
lamb!</p>

<p>The dark shadows which rested on the heart of the
repentant husband threw their gloomy shade now over
the heart-happy mother. For the same fear possessed
them both. The old fear! That puerile fear—and
yet, the most potent: What will the world say?
Garston feared the black record of his cowardly abandonment,
and the victorious mother found that,
though innocent, she dared not tell the whole truth.</p>

<p>Innocent at heart, realizing the only means to save
her child from the man whom she secretly feared,
when Elaine Willoughby went back, incognito, to
reappear at Vienna on her homeward way, she only
caught her loving child to her breast in a torrent of
silent tears, when Romaine Garland murmured:
“You never speak of my father!”</p>

<p>“Do not ask me yet, my darling!” she sobbed. “I
want you all to myself now. Ask me nothing yet.”</p>

<p>And though the Lady of Lakemere had hoodwinked
all of Garston’s spies, though she had returned
unanswered, the letters from her husband sent to her
by messenger on her return, and held the secret of his
guilty past over his head, she felt that this armed
inactivity could not continue forever. The battle must
be fought out, and either lost or won. She renewed
her courage.</p>

<p>She could not lie to her child, and her eyes had
dropped before the appealing glances of the restored
one. A hundred varied plans were considered on
that long ocean return voyage.</p>

<p><a id="png.305" href="#png.305"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>303<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Too well she knew that she dared not settle down in
Europe and leave Harold Vreeland’s unpunished
crime behind her.</p>

<p>The secret hidden in the stolen document was
momentous! She could not abandon her comrades
in their speculations without vindicating her trust in
honor.</p>

<p>An option, under the guarantee of her faithful syndicate
friends to allow “certain persons” to purchase
“certain stocks” at a fixed valuation was in that fateful
record. Its loss meant the ruin of many reputations.
Perhaps, too, the crash of vast fortunes.</p>

<p>The betrayal of a trust which Alynton had imposed
upon her, and for which she had been selected by
the “secret syndicate”—the gods of local finance!
She must leave the secret circle with clean hands.</p>

<p>So far, she was safe!</p>

<p>As yet, the thief had not dared to use it. Its fatal
power was still veiled from her dearest foe, James
Garston, the husband of her youthful flower, whom all
men once honored as Arnold Cranstoun.</p>

<p>“My God!” shuddered Elaine. “If Garston should
obtain that document it would be my ruin. All would
believe that I had sold their secrets to others. I would
be at his mercy. It must not be.</p>

<p>“If he—Vreeland—can be trapped, if a silent surrender
is safely effected, then I could give up my trust,
leave America, and seek happiness abroad with
Romaine, my beautiful darling.”</p>

<p>But though she knew that Harold Vreeland would
dare to make no public use of the document, though
she was positive that fear of political scandal would
seal James Garston’s lips, she dared not deny, in her
lone watches under the stars, that the man whom she
<a id="png.306" href="#png.306"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>304<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>had banished was still her husband—“till death do us
part.”</p>

<p>And if Vreeland was the thief, he could sell her
to shame in all men’s eyes if Garston would shield
him.</p>

<p>She knew further that there was no mercy in Garston’s
love-maddened heart now!</p>

<p>And a bitter thought haunted her over the dark
Atlantic waters. “My child’s future! She can not
marry under the suspicion of illegitimate birth, and
she shall never deem her mother to have been a guilty
wanton.”</p>

<p>Even Judge Endicott and the chivalric Hugh
Conyers knew but half the truth. Both had assumed
that there had been an early and unhappy marriage,
and both only believed that Elaine Willoughby was
merely fighting for the custody of a child whom they
knew not to be of legal age.</p>

<p>“If they knew more, I would either have to clear
myself by the whole truth, or else be disgraced in
their eyes,” she murmured.</p>

<p>And on the instant call of her New York agents she
had returned now to strike a death blow to all Harold
Vreeland’s criminal schemes. But she was so sadly
weak in her own defenses, against the laws of nature,
of God’s holy sacrament of marriage, and the pleading
eyes of her innocent child! And yet Vreeland’s
demoralization forced desperate measures upon her
now. If he should die or abscond, then, there was
ruin to face.</p>

<p>And on this night, when her husband mourned in
agony over his forfeited paradise and his childless
age, the unhappy wife and mother only awaited the
moment when Harold Vreeland would fall into the
<a id="png.307" href="#png.307"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>305<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>snares so skillfully set for him. That victory won,
then she would bid adieu to the “Street’s” mad ventures,
her secret trust once resigned, peace, love and
happiness awaited her at Lake Malar. But safety
first, peace afterward. She felt whither the undercurrent
of speculation had swept her. On a lee shore!</p>

<p>“I can tell Romaine all when she is my very own,
and she shall choose between us then, and judge us
both.</p>

<p>“She alone has the right to the truth.”</p>

<p>This vow upon her knees had quieted Margaret
Cranstoun’s heart, for she only now awaited Roundsman
Dan Daly’s coming triumph to summon Senator
Alynton.</p>

<p>Once the document was honorably out of her
hands, then the Queen of the Street could abdicate,
and go “far from the madding crowd,” where “beyond
their voices there is peace.” The hour of loathing her
excited environment had come at last.</p>

<p>It seemed as if some subtle commune of spirit had
brought the long-estranged husband and wife together
in spirit on this very evening, for Margaret Cranstoun
dreamed of the loyal husband of her youth, when she
fell asleep, murmuring “Lead, kindly Light.” There
were angels pleading with them both—angels of white,
unfolded wings. For the child’s sake, they pleaded for
a hearing.</p>

<p>And the next morning she was shaken at heart, as
the gusty pines are thrilled by the wild winds of night,
when she read the long appeal wrung from Arnold
Cranstoun’s heart by the hours of his lonely midnight
agony. His agony had overmastered the proud spirit
at last.</p>

<p>The deserted wife’s tears fell on the blotted pages
<a id="png.308" href="#png.308"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>306<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>over which the strong man had leaned in all the ecstasy
of a last appeal.</p>

<p>He knew that there would be an answer, for his messenger
was bidden to return.</p>

<p>And all that day, James Garston waited, while his
estranged wife trembled at the voice of her own heart,
and bowed her head over her daughter’s picture in an
agony of speechless love. She dared all for herself,
but only to save the child of her hungry heart.</p>

<p>She feared the fatal sentence of these awful words of
Holy Writ: “For the sins of the fathers shall be
visited upon the heads of the children.” That thought
brought her to her knees now, and she walked alone in
the dark valley of silent sorrows.</p>

<p>Brought to bay by the wild appeal, the excited woman
realized that she dare not confer with either Alynton,
Endicott or Conyers. The still unsoiled woman-heart
revolted at the unveiling of all the sorrows of a shadowed
life—those secret sorrows which had haunted her
in all the gilded scenes of a strange prosperity, her
burden carried under the veil of secrecy—her galling
chain of secret sorrows.</p>

<p>“For the child’s sake!” she murmured, as she
vainly essayed to answer her recreant husband’s
proposals.</p>

<p>A dozen times she had read over his last logical
conclusion: “If you and I are to respect the
untroubled heart of the innocent child whom I have
never seen, then we must leave it to her alone to
decide in the future as to whether she shall go on
through life as a fatherless girl.</p>

<p>“You might be taken away; I might pay the
penalty of nature. What would become of our child
then? Can you answer? And even if I am a husband no
<a id="png.309" href="#png.309"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>307<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>longer, you have no power to decree that I am not a
father. And you and I alone can settle a situation
leading on to madness or despair. As for the spoliation
of our daughter, I will prevent that, but is that
all?—answer me, for God’s sake—is that all of life?—the
mere money provision? Dare you say it is?”</p>

<p>Elaine Willoughby recognized at once his coldly
practical mind in the propositions.</p>

<p>“For all our sakes,” he pleaded, “I will die to the
world as Arnold Cranstoun, if you agree; and I swear
before God, that if you agree that I will only
approach Romaine Garland as a stranger, unless in
later years you may lift the ban. For never lived
man or woman who could foretell the future workings
of the chainless human heart. Let us make some
joint provision for her future safety. In God’s name—for
the child’s sake.” His words echoed in her
heart, and not in vain.</p>

<p>A meeting at the Hotel Belgravia in a week’s time
was the proposal.</p>

<p>A family friend of Senator Garston’s had placed his
apartments at the husband’s disposal. “We are
neither of us known there; you can previously enter the
hotel and observe the rooms.</p>

<p>“In the evening at nine o’clock on the day you
select, I will be at the door, and you can close the
sorrows of a whole life, in a half-hour given up to
mercy.”</p>

<p>“For the child’s sake, be it so!” she cried as she
read over the proposal once more.</p>

<p>Her task was to bring every letter and relic of
their married days and to witness their destruction.</p>

<p>“Then our child can never be shadowed by my
guilty past,” his hand had traced.</p>

<p><a id="png.310" href="#png.310"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>308<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“I am sure of your silence. I will go on undisgraced
to the end of my career. I will cease to pursue
you and her.</p>

<p>“I am to give you the receipt of the International
Trust Company for two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars of United States bonds, registered in the
name of Romaine Garland.</p>

<p>“And I am to leave her in my will one-half of all
my property. There is then to be silence—oblivion;
for me repentance, for you peace, and so, for her in
time, the enjoyment of her own.</p>

<p>“Should she learn from you in later years that
James Garston was her father, there will at least be
no cloud upon her name, and I leave the key of the
future in your hands.</p>

<p>“This I would guarantee before either of the three
men whom you trust; but, I implore peace and
silence, for the child’s sake.</p>

<p>“Our only guarantee in this interview of good faith
is the one unbroken tie between us, the child whom I
have never seen.”</p>

<p>It was late in the day when James Garston read the
lines traced by the hand which had once trembled
lovingly in his own.</p>

<p>“I will come! I will trust to you once more, under
the protection of the memories of all my sorrows, but
only for the child’s sake. Our past is dead. Let us
place the seal of silence upon its tomb. I will do as
you bid me.”</p>

<p>There was a strange light in Senator Garston’s face
as he hurried out of the Plaza Hotel, and when in the
corridor, he met Harold Vreeland, he wrested himself
from that desperate gamester’s clutches. He dared
not break away from the haggard outcast. There was
<a id="png.311" href="#png.311"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>309<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the meeting with Elaine—the one aim now of his
awakened soul.</p>

<p>“Come into the writing-room,” said the Senator,
after he had heard an appeal which caused him to fear
that the man’s mind was wavering.</p>

<p>“Remember, sir,” sternly said the Western millionaire,
“I know where the money is going. And it
is the very last dollar of mine that you will ever see.
Your wife”—Garston stopped, shamefaced, for the
shadow of a darling sin now rose up between him
and the new-born hope of meeting his own child in
the coming years.</p>

<p>The spell of Margaret Cranstoun was strong upon
him now. “I can atone; Katharine shall not live to suffer
poverty,” he groaned, as Vreeland sped away with
a check for forty thousand dollars. And so, a manly
throb of remorse made him generous to Katharine
Norreys’ hoodwinked husband.</p>

<p>The rain was falling in torrents when the hooded
form of a stately woman descended at the Hotel Belgravia
on a storm-darkened night a week later. The
drenched cabman wondered at the hurried liberality
of his fare, and then hastened away far beyond the
row of blinking lights.</p>

<p>Up the stairway to the first story, the visitor sped
with no uncertain foot, the “parlor watch” noticing
with surprise the white robes beneath the lady’s
shrouding cloakings. For it was a fearful night without;
those festal robes were but a mockery in the
storm-lashed darkness.</p>

<p>“One of our regulars caught out in this squall,”
sleepily muttered the waiter, resuming his novel.</p>

<p>Onward, guided by a surely retentive memory, the
<a id="png.312" href="#png.312"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>310<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>woman sped through the halls, and pressed her hand
upon a doorknob which yielded to her touch.</p>

<p>The door was quickly closed, and there, surrounded
by all the belongings of a happy family circle, the
long sundered foes met in silence before a cheerful
fire which blazed upon the hearth.</p>

<p>In James Garston’s startled eyes there was an
expression of wondering mystery. For with a woman’s
self-protective instinct, his estranged wife had eluded
her household at the “Circassia,” and stolen away
from the dinner circle, robed in a costume of stainless
white.</p>

<p>Down the deserted side stairway, she had fled,
swathed in secretly purchased storm wrappings such
as a woman of the people might wear. And now, she
looked strangely young and fair as he sprang toward
her. She had not been recognized by the hotel
attaches; no one had seen her leave the “Circassia.”</p>

<p>And neither Justine, the watchful, nor the amanuensis
knew—not even the butler detective—that their
mistress had gone forth in the storm, her own apartment
doors being locked. She had victoriously passed
all the dangers which she feared. A wild haste now
possessed her; only to be safe at home again!</p>

<p>In silence Elaine Willoughby placed a bundle upon
the table, and then, the eyes of the unhappy couple met.</p>

<p>“It is all there—everything,” faltered Margaret
Cranstoun. “Hasten, for I must save myself; I can
not linger. This visit must be kept a secret from all,
for the child’s sake. Examine and destroy them!”</p>

<p>There was that in her eyes which compelled obedience,
and the beautiful woman stood clutching at a
table, as Garston, with a mighty effort at self-control,
glancing rapidly at each faded token, cast them one
<a id="png.313" href="#png.313"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>311<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>by one into the fire. Ashes of life, “dead fruits of the
fugitive years!”</p>

<p>The flames merrily leaped up, and without the wild
storm lashed the window-panes. In a few moments,
the work of destruction was complete.</p>

<p>Margaret Cranstoun started back as her husband
faced her, for some overmastering emotion now
quickly convulsed his strong face. A strange fear
palsied her tongue. She had never seen that ashen
look upon his strong face in life before.</p>

<p>“There is the Trust Company’s receipt,” he said,
speaking as if in a dream, while his eyes roved over
her loveliness, as she stood there with her trembling
hands clasped on her heaving bosom. A woman to
draw men to her feet—a throbbing, passionate, love-haunted
queen—the apotheosis of love!</p>

<p>“Do you agree to my proposition about my will?”
the Senator slowly said; “and I may at some future
day hope to <span class="nw">see—”</span></p>

<p>He paused abruptly, for Margaret Cranstoun reeled.
Her strength was failing; there were strange shadows
in the room; the fitful fire glared in weird flashes!</p>

<p>“Let me go! Let me go!” she cried. “You can
write to me as before.”</p>

<p>“I must go!”</p>

<p>For there were strange shadows gathering on his
convulsed face.</p>

<p>She turned as if to flee. Her husband was too
quick for her.</p>

<p>With a single bound he reached the door and
locked it.</p>

<p>“Margaret!” he wildly cried, as he crushed her to
his breast, “the past is dead. Its record lies there,
ashes to ashes—the ashes of a dead life!</p>

<p><a id="png.314" href="#png.314"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>312<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Let me live! Let us go on to the end together.</p>

<p>“No one would know. If we were married now,
in due form, the silence of the past would be unbroken.
It is my last prayer. Forgive!”</p>

<p>The frightened woman was struggling in his relentless
grasp, as he pleaded “for the child’s sake!”</p>

<p>She made one last despairing effort to break his
frenzied hold upon her, but she stood there helpless
and transfixed in horror, as his arms relaxed and he
suddenly sank at her feet, lying there prone upon the
tapestried floor. The Dark Angel’s wings had
touched his pallid brow.</p>

<p>The shriek of horror was frozen on her lips by a
sudden fear, and then grasping at her draperies, she
fled away through the open door of the next apartment.
She dared not glance behind her, for death
was there!</p>

<p>Now, between her and that locked door lay the
nameless thing which was but now a strong man, the
peer of kings! The despairing lover who had died
with the last frenzied words of reawakened tenderness
upon his lips! The husband of her youth!</p>

<p>The majesty of Death had entered unannounced, and
that night, in far-away Sweden, Romaine Garland,
praying for the mother whom she had recovered from
Shadowland, stirred in the sleep of maidenhood to
murmur, “My father!” For in the vast empyrean
James Garston had found his child—at last!</p>

<p>A glance showed to the entrapped woman a stout
partition wall leading from a window opened into a
side court to the long hotel corridor on the other side.</p>

<p>Spurred on by a blind impulse of self-protection,
Elaine Willoughby sprang lightly across the dividing
<a id="png.315" href="#png.315"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>313<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>wall and raised the window on the other side of the
covered court.</p>

<p>There was no one in the silent corridor. Her
beating heart told her that here was safety.</p>

<p>It was but the work of a moment to cast her cloak
around her, and a side entrance offered her an unobserved
descent to the level of the street.</p>

<p>“If that door should be locked!” was her heart’s
wild alarm.</p>

<p>But no, it yielded, and then with a swift step she
sped along in the storm, not daring to look behind
her in the night!</p>

<p>The rains of heaven had cooled her brow as she
halted far away before a row of carriages standing
before a theater. The sleepy driver only growled
“All right,” as he heard the words “Central Park
West.”</p>

<p>He never knew that the half-fainting woman who
stopped him on a corner twenty minutes later, was the
one possessor of a mystery which was the sensation of
the whole city next morning.</p>

<p>“Women are queer creatures!” babbled the sleepy
driver, as he sought the nearest saloon, while his
fare disappeared under the gloomy darkness of the
walls of the “Circassia.”</p>

<p>“Now what business could take a decent woman
out a night like this?” But he had substantial cause
for rejoicing, and he blessed her on her way. For
she paid him the price of a life—all unknown to his
gratified cupidity.</p>

<p>There was silence in the halls of the “Circassia” as
Mrs. Elaine Willoughby swept down the corridors
now draped only in her white dinner dress. The
dark wraps, cast away on the servants’ stairway, told
<a id="png.316" href="#png.316"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>314<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>no story of the undetected outing, and, with a trembling
hand, the frightened woman opened the side
door of the Pearl boudoir.</p>

<p>An hour later there was hurrying to and fro in her
household. “It is one of Madame’s old attacks,”
Justine explained to Doctor Anderson, hastily summoned
by the private secretary.</p>

<p>For after instinctively hiding away the document
thrust into her bosom, the paper which gave to
fatherless Romaine Garland a fortune, Elaine Willoughby
had fainted away, with her hand upon the
bell, as she mechanically summoned help in the hour
of her agony. And the price of her safety was a near
approach to the grave!</p>

<p>On the next morning the journals of fifty cities
told millions of readers of the sudden death of the
Western magnate, Senator James Garston, and the
various political cabals were busied with selecting
his successor. Death had robbed him of the civic
crown, and a stately head was lying low.</p>

<p>Senator Alynton, while hurrying from Washington
to New York on business, read all the details of the
attack of heart failure which had cut off the strong
man in the flower of his life.</p>

<p>“This is a serious business,” he murmured, but his
impassive face never showed his secret solicitude lest
the papers of the dead man might expose the operations
of a syndicate “for revenue only.” He wore
the impassive mask of the millionaire politician.</p>

<p>There was the look of a wild despair in Katharine
Vreeland’s eyes when she awakened her heavy-eyed
husband from the sleep of exhaustion the next
morning.</p>

<p>“Get up!” she sternly said.</p>

<p><a id="png.317" href="#png.317"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>315<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Here is news to frighten even you into being a
man for a day. Senator Garston died last night of
heart disease at the Hotel Belgravia.”</p>

<p>“Good God! We are ruined!” cried Vreeland.</p>

<p>“For all your fortune was in his hands. You have
not a scrap of paper to show for it.”</p>

<p>“What do I care for the money!” she sobbed. “I
am alone in the world now.”</p>

<h3 title="XV. In the dark waters"

 class="ns">[</span>316<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="chaphead">IN THE DARK WATERS.</p>


<p>Senator David Alynton’s first duty on reaching the
Hotel Belgravia was to hold a private conference with
the confidential friend in whose rooms the Senator-elect
had so strangely died. The body of the dead
millionaire had been removed at once to his own personal
apartments at the Hotel Plaza, where the travelers
found assembled Garston’s lawyer, his physician,
with his body servant. The private secretary was in
charge, under the superintendence of a cool representative
of the International Trust Company.</p>

<p>It touched Alynton to the heart, this lonely death
chamber; for it seemed that “there was no one left
to mourn for Logan.”</p>

<p>It is true that Mrs. Katharine Vreeland, in deepest
black, was kneeling silently there at the foot of the
coffin, ostentatiously supported by Mrs. Volney
McMorris, whose social splendors were judiciously
darkened for the time being by bits of crepe, like
the veiling of the “bright work” on a fire engine at
an old Volunteer Department funeral.</p>

<p>“Are there no near family relatives?” asked Alynton,
in a muffled voice, as he gazed upon the majestic
frame of the man who had fought himself up from
disgrace to the Tantalus cup of triumph. It seemed
a dreary, a lonely, an unwept taking-off!</p>

<p>“It seems not,” guardedly answered the Trust
Company’s factotum. “We have his will in charge.
The young lady kneeling there will be a large
<a id="png.319" href="#png.319"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>317<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>beneficiary, and besides her, there is only one other legatee,
who it seems is a ward of Mrs. Elaine Willoughby,
the great woman stock operator.”</p>

<p>Senator Alynton started in surprise. “As the late
Mr. Garston was only a Senator-elect, I presume there
will be no Governmental notice taken of his decease.</p>

<p>“We look, therefore, to you, Senator Alynton, to
Mr. Haygood Apchurch, his old friend (in whose
rooms he died) and to these two interested young
women beneficiaries, for all directions as to the
funeral.”</p>

<p>“That is,” hastily added the Trust Company’s
Cerberus, “if no swarm of hungry relatives, no duplicate
wives nor mysterious claimants turn up when the
Associated Press dispatches have been read all over
America.</p>

<p>“Such things have happened before.”</p>

<p>“It seems strange,” mused Alynton, after giving a
few brief directions, “that such a man lived and died
entirely unloved.”</p>

<p>But goaded on by self-interest, he hastened away
to the “Circassia,” after vainly telephoning all over
New York for Harold Vreeland. The “rising star”
was in a dark eclipse!</p>

<p>At the Hotel Savoy, the suave head clerk, with a
sigh, admitted that the young banker’s habits were
now very “irregular.”</p>

<p>“He has not been seen to-day. He went out very
early,” was the clerk’s report, and he vaguely indicated
Vreeland’s principal operations with an upward sweep
of his lily-white hand.</p>

<p>The clerk was a purist in manner, and only beginning
himself to drink secretly. He was not yet in the
dark waters!</p>

<p><a id="png.320" href="#png.320"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>318<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Senator Alynton found Mrs. Elaine Willoughby
strictly denied to all visitors. It was to the clear-eyed
cripple that he gravely handed his card.</p>

<p>“Please say to Mrs. Willoughby that I must see her
before Senator Garston’s funeral. I am at the Waldorf,
and will come at once on her summons.”</p>

<p>On his way to the Belgravia, Senator Alynton read
the “copious accounts” in the leading journals. The
case seemed to be a clear one. The newspapers confirmed
Mr. Haygood Apchurch’s statement that the
dead millionaire had borrowed his friend’s apartments
to use a couple of weeks in briefing up a great speech
upon “the financial situation.” A speech destined
never to be delivered!</p>

<p>In fact, some of the drafts of the future masterpiece,
and the usual personal contents of a rich man’s
pocketbook were the only papers found in the rooms.
There was not even the foundation stone of a mystery.</p>

<p>The checks, railway passes, club cards, etc., were
not accompanied by a single family paper.</p>

<p>It was “justly remarked by all that the country had
sustained a great loss in the counsels of so distinguished
and successful a Western money magnate
as James Garston,” etc., in the usual vein.</p>

<p>Alynton glanced over the platitudes as to being
“cut off in his prime,” the usual references, <i lang="fr">de rigueur</i>,
to the “zenith of his powers,” and his being a man
of “an already national reputation”—the lightly tossed
journalistic wreath of immortelles!</p>

<p>One or two daring writers had timidly referred to
the long fight which had raised the deceased from a
working Western low-grade lawyer in a mining town
to a money power in the financial centers of the East
and West.</p>

<p><a id="png.321" href="#png.321"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>319<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“That no immediate family falls heir to the honorable
record of the departed is an element of sadness
crowning a lonely career, embittered by many hard
struggles with fate.”</p>

<p>Such perfunctory phrases covered the gap between
the unknown past of the “man who had arrived” and
the lonely splendor of his final elevation.</p>

<p>After Alynton had satisfied himself that Mr. Haygood Apchurch knew nothing whatever of Garston’s
past, the distinguished member of the secret
syndicate drove rapidly down to Judge Hiram Endicott’s
office.</p>

<p>His mind was now agitated with fears of the future
of the sugar speculating syndicate of a “few friends.”</p>

<p>In his feverish haste to make the living safe he had
already forgotten the unloved dead man. He had
not disturbed the silent grief of the repentant woman
who bent over the pale silent lips now sealed in death.</p>

<p>The eyes were sightless now which had thrilled
their unspoken messages into her very soul.</p>

<p>And the stormy heart of James Garston was as cold
and pulseless as the marble wherein the tenantless
shell would soon lie in the long rest.</p>

<p>Suddenly Katharine Vreeland threw up her arms
and fell at the feet of her woman friend, wildly <span class="nw">sobbing—</span></p>

<p>“There lies the only heart in God’s world that ever
beat for me!”</p>

<p>“Ah! Some one loved him after all,” mused the
Trust Company’s financial representative. “She
deserves her good fortune. I wonder does she know of
the other one?” His mind was busied with curious conjectures
as to the source of the dead man’s generosity.</p>

<p>But the gates of the past were swung forever. The
<a id="png.322" href="#png.322"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>320<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>trembling heart of the “Western heiress” held a secret
that was now sealed behind the mask of Garston’s
waxen face.</p>

<p>For the strong man, loyal in his darling sin, was
true as steel to the last, and the hidden crime of two
lives “left no dark plume as a token.”</p>

<p>Alynton, closeted with Judge Endicott, was now
urgent in his demand that Mrs. Elaine Willoughby
should at once erase the name of the dead Senator
from the dangerous document held by her in a mysterious
trust. “That document must never see the
light.” It must be destroyed at once, and a new
“round robin” signed.</p>

<p>“It will have to be surrendered now, and a new
one made,” anxiously said the excited millionaire.</p>

<p>“We owe safety to our living associates, and perfect
faith to our allied friends of the Sugar Syndicate.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps as Mrs. Willoughby was a close friend of
Garston’s she may know some of the details of his early
life. I wish that you would have her guide me. Go
and see her. I am in practical charge of the funeral,
and so shall be very busy.”</p>

<p>“What can she know?” demanded the old lawyer.</p>

<p>“I’m told by the Trust Company’s man that he has
left half of his great fortune to a young ward of Mrs. Willoughby’s—some young girl.” There was a tinkling
sound of breakage.</p>

<p>Alynton gazed curiously at the old Judge as he
slowly picked up the fragments of his shattered eyeglasses.</p>

<p>“You are right. Do nothing till you hear from me.
I will go to her, and come to you at the Waldorf,” said
the startled lawyer. “She should know of this at
once.”</p>

<p><a id="png.323" href="#png.323"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>321<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Thank God! He knows nothing of Garston’s mad
pursuit of Elaine in marriage and his schemes about
her child. He even thinks them friends. Better so.
But, the girl must return at once. Death has made
her way smooth.” And Endicott went sighing on
his way.</p>

<p>Telephoning for Hugh Conyers, the old advocate
hastened to the “Circassia” to a conference with the
white-faced invalid who burst into a storm of tears
when Endicott told her the story of the strange legacy.</p>

<p>“Let Hugh cable at once to Stockholm. Have
them come back here by Havre, without a moment’s
delay. Let him sign all three of our names,
and let him also send a separate cable to Sara that
Romaine is to know nothing of the death, and not a
word as yet, of this strange legacy. I will inform her
of that myself,” she sobbed. “It is all so strange, so
ghastly,” she murmured.</p>

<p>The self-protective instinct of the mother brought
to her a new life. “No one knows; no one even suspects.
There is not a single whisper. Thank God!”
And then she vowed on her knees, when left alone, to
be brave and true for the child’s sake.</p>

<p>And Hiram Endicott respected her imperial grief.
When he returned from dispatching Conyers to recall
the fatherless child, he mused: “It is better that I
should know nothing more, for there is a strange
tangle here.”</p>

<p>And so he was not astonished when his client bade
him come back to her on the morrow to escort her to
the room of Garston’s last solemn public reception.</p>

<p>“I must see him again for Romaine’s sake. I must
look once more upon the face of the father of my
child,” was the solemn voice of Nature sweeping away
<a id="png.324" href="#png.324"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>322<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>all the meshes of the frail barrier of human hatred
which had held them apart.</p>

<p>“God is merciful,” she murmured. “Romaine shall
never know, and only learn to wonder over the benefaction
of an unknown but generous hand.</p>

<p>“And now, his public name, his barren honors can
never be soiled by man’s cold sneer. It is the blessed
nepenthe of the silent grave.”</p>

<p>Elaine Willoughby was recalled to a need of stern
and instant action by Endicott’s demand for the document,
the vastly dangerous paper whose existence now
alarmed Senator Alynton. And all alert, she bade
her schoolboy servitor summon Roundsman Daly
instantly.</p>

<p>“I must forego my full vengeance on Vreeland,” she
murmured, “to save my friends. The paper once
regained, I can leave the Street forever, but Vreeland’s
silence must be first assured. It is better to
steal it from its hiding-place, and not wait to trap him
there.”</p>

<p>She was keenly suspicious of Justine Duprez, who,
hollow-eyed and half-defiant, now demanded an
absence of a few days on urgent private affairs. The
girl’s burning fever of fear for her lover was almost
an ecstasy of jealous agony. She feared a coming
storm.</p>

<p>With a single touch of the bell, the Lady of Lakemere
called in the private detective. “Detain that
woman here, even by the strongest use of force, till
Roundsman Daly comes,” she said, with flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>“She is dangerous. Remember! force if needed.
And, do not lose her from your sight an instant.”</p>

<p>In ten minutes, Daly, with a strange light of battle in
<a id="png.325" href="#png.325"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>323<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>his eyes, stood before Mrs. Willoughby. “It is now just
the time to spring the trap!” he said. “I have two
men steadily on watch down in South Fifth Avenue.
Vreeland has been lurking around here to warn Justine
to meet him at once. He intends, I am sure, to
leave the country, for I have already arrested Helms
and the letter-carrier, Mulholland. You must act,
and at once, or you will lose the bird.”</p>

<p>“Then,” cried Elaine Willoughby, turning ashen
in her heart-sinking, “hasten to the rooms yourself.
Arrest him! Get the paper! It must come to me
alone, whatever happens—remember that. There is
human life, public honor and the happiness of innocent
hearts all hanging on your success. For God’s
sake, hasten! Bring me that paper!” A ferocious
joy gleamed in Daly’s eyes.</p>

<p>He felt for his Colt’s police pistol and his steel
handcuffs.</p>

<p>“Hold the Frenchwoman tightly. Lock her up by
force! I will be here in an hour, and the paper
shall reach no one’s eyes but mine.</p>

<p>“But as to Justine, let Dobson arrest her, and handcuff
her. Give her a good frightening, but watch her
that she does herself no harm.”</p>

<p>As Daly stole down the side stairs of the “Circassia,”
there was a muffled scream as the handcuffs
closed on the plump wrists of Justine Duprez. It
was the beginning of the end, and Harold Vreeland
had lost his last friend. He was in the jaws of Fate
now.</p>

<p>“Dobson has made sure. Now for my man, and to
pay off old scores!” cried Dan Daly, as he sprang into
a carriage.</p>

<p>“To South Fifth Avenue!” he cried. “Drive like
<a id="png.326" href="#png.326"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>324<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>hell. I’ll make you rich for a year!” he sharply commanded.</p>

<p>Far away, crouching in the squalid room, watching
the frail door and listening for the sound of a well-known
footstep, haggard-eyed and desperate, Harold
Vreeland waited like a wolf at bay. His brain,
burning with alcohol, was now reeling with the
violence of his emotions.</p>

<p>“Only to square her with money, to get her away
to the rendezvous in Paris, or to see her safely in hiding
among the French <i lang="fr">déclassées<!-- TN: original reads "declassées" --></i> here till she can
sneak away. Then I’ll remove the paper, and after
that take the first steamer and seek safety and revenge!</p>

<p>“I can get a steerage suite at Hoboken. There are
several steamers to-morrow morning. No one will
know, and I’ve money enough left for a whole year.”
He felt for the twenty bills of a thousand dollars
each which he had held back from the check begged
from Garston. A legacy of unsuspected shame!</p>

<p>Tired and wearied, he returned again and again to
his brandy flask. And then his head dropped and his
cigar fell from his hand as he dropped into a half-drunken
stupor.</p>

<p>He awoke at a slight noise and raised his head. He
fixed his glazed eyes on the door.</p>

<p>“She is coming!” he muttered. “I’ll get the paper
out now, and all will be ready for a start.”</p>

<p>With a knife, he sprang back the loose plating from
the door frame.</p>

<p>Standing on a chair, he had already grasped the
paper in his trembling hand when the door suddenly
gave way with a crash, and three burly men leaped
into the room.</p>

<p>He sprang to the floor, but strong arms seized him.</p>

<p><a id="png.327" href="#png.327"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>325<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>For the first time in his life, Harold Vreeland felt
the snapping of handcuffs. “The jig is up!” cried
Daly, facing the astounded culprit.</p>

<p>“I arrest you, Harold Vreeland, for robbing the
United States mail,” cried a deputy marshal; but
Dan Daly had already wrenched the stolen document
from the hand of the ruined trickster. He remembered
the last injunctions of the woman he served.</p>

<p>It was now safely hidden in his breast and lying
against the picture of the girl whom Daly had sworn
to make the happiest wife in New York. The one
who would rule his little home!</p>

<p>“Hold on to him, boys!” cried Daly, as he stepped
away into a side room and anxiously gazed at the
paper which he had recovered. Yes, it was the same
one, for he had only waited weeks to catch the scoundrel
with the document in his unlawful possession.
The secret of the hiding-place was his alone. He
called the schoolboy a “shadow” no longer, for the
work was done.</p>

<p>“Take my carriage. Get back and tell the mistress
that I have got the paper she wants. Speak to
no one else; and tell her that Vreeland will be put in a
cell alone in Ludlow Street Jail as a United States
prisoner. He’ll have no chance to talk!</p>

<p>“I’ll follow you up soon, see her, and then go and
have him stowed away. I will bring the paper up to
her myself. Hurry now, for God’s sake! I’ll take
Helms and that French devil away later. Tell her
not to breathe a word to a living soul. I am acting
outside of the law.</p>

<p>“Any one of the stolen letters that we found with
Helms will do to convict him with. I’ve got one here to
show up,” mused Daly, “and now the three wretches
<a id="png.328" href="#png.328"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>326<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>up there will all be eager to confess. It only remains
to nab that scoundrel Alberg, and to face him with
the returned Wilmot woman. It’s nearly all over.
My God! What’s that?”</p>

<p>Dan Daly sprang back into the main room, pistol in
hand, as a deafening explosion rang out. His eyes
rested on a body lying at his feet.</p>

<p>“How did this happen?” he yelled, as one of the
detectives excitedly knelt over Harold Vreeland lying
there dying on the floor.</p>

<p>The last words came faintly to Vreeland’s trembling
lips, flecked with a bloody froth:</p>

<p>“Justine, poor girl, tell her—money—oh, God!—water!—water!”—muttered
the dying man, as his
head fell back. He lay there, the man of art and
graces—the man who had played out the lone hand in
Life—dead at their feet, with the steel bands still
upon his pulseless wrists. It was a barren victory!</p>

<p>“It was all done quick as a flash, Dan!” whispered
the disgraced detective. “He was seemingly docile,
and asked me for a drink of water as you went out. I
turned to get it. He had seen me put back my pistol.</p>

<p>“With his handcuffed hands he swiftly plucked it
out, then one touch of the trigger, and there he lies.”</p>

<p>“It is the will of God,” said Daly, gravely.
“There’ll be no newspaper scandal and public exposure
now. He has gone before the higher court. Wait here.
Let no one enter. We must call it a drink suicide.”</p>

<p>Daly leaped away like a leopard on the chase to be
the first to seal Mrs. Willoughby’s lips forever as to
this happening, and to hand over the document which
had cost the dead scoundrel his life. With grave
faces, the detectives watched the stiffening form upon
the floor. The “rising star” had set forever!</p>

<p><a id="png.329" href="#png.329"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>327<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Only the silent, weeping, widowed woman at the
Hotel Savoy knew the whirlwind of baffled hate which
had filled Vreeland’s wretched breast as he staggered
away from his wife’s rooms that morning.</p>

<p>Their quarrel had been the unveiling of an unpunished
crime—a tangle of sin and shame.</p>

<p>For smarting under the loss of a “financial backer”
who could not refuse him money advances, Vreeland
had faced his wife with the direct query, so long
withheld, as to her separate property.</p>

<p>“You must now aid me with your cash, money,
property or whatever else you have. Garston’s death
leaves me without a friend.”</p>

<p>Standing among the scattered pyramids of fashion’s
evening uniforms, Katharine Vreeland turned her
bright, defiant eyes upon the half-insane speculator.
How she despised him in her guilty heart!</p>

<p>“I have neither money nor friends. All I had to
hope for died with James Garston. You were not man
enough to demand an accounting of the living.</p>

<p>“And now death pays all debts. I have absolutely
nothing to <span class="nw">show—”</span></p>

<p>Vreeland had seized his wife’s wrist.</p>

<p>“You were <span class="nw">his—”</span></p>

<p>“Ward,” quietly retorted the beautiful rebel.</p>

<p>“And, sir, you took me as I took you, on trust!
They told me that you were rich. I find you out to
be a mere coward—a fool and a weakling, too! You
have thrown away the handsome fortune which James
Garston gave you. What has become of your own
money?</p>

<p>“And your humbug ‘business interests’ down in
Wall Street. Were you, too, only an ‘outside agent’
<a id="png.330" href="#png.330"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>328<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>for Mrs. Willoughby—a mere paper screen for her
speculations? What have you to show me?”</p>

<p>Vreeland’s whitened face proved his silent rage.
“Our paths separate here!” bitterly said Katharine
Vreeland. “If you have nothing, I have less. Not
even a husband! Do you see that door?” she cried,
with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>“Never cross its threshold again. Leave me to my
dead friend, my dead hopes, my dead heart—and my
poverty.” She was brave to the last, even in her
abandonment.</p>

<p>With a last curse, lost upon the ears of the defiant
woman now hidden in her own room, Vreeland had
turned away to his flight, leaving his wife penniless,
and he departed with but one last mad hope.</p>

<p>To bear away Justine Duprez, the only witness, to
rescue the incriminating document, and then divide
with the artful Frenchwoman the remaining twenty
thousand dollars of the loan forced from Garston.
For his deserted wife he had not even a thought!</p>

<p>“Once safe in Paris, Justine can easily hide me there.
I can easily extort a fortune from Mrs. Willoughby and
her rich associates. Justine can marry and have
her petit hôtel. The document will be a wellspring
of flowing golden treasure.”</p>

<p>And so in his last hours of life, the woman whom
he would once have sacrificed became his only hope,
and to draw her to his presence at their only safe
trysting place he had gone to the “Circassia” for the
last time. But she could not see his furtive signals,
his hovering around. She herself was under lock and
key now!</p>

<p>The artful schemer proved in death the truth of Mr. James Potter’s favorite adage, for his punishment
<a id="png.331" href="#png.331"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>329<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>“came around, like everything else, to the man who
waited,” and he only waited in vain, for Justine
Duprez’s footfall. But, grim Death found him out
red-handed in his miserable treachery.</p>

<p>Judge Endicott was closeted with Mrs. Willoughby
as Roundsman Dan Daly sprang into the room and led
the trembling woman to a corner.</p>

<p>When they were alone, Daly whispered:</p>

<p>“Just step into your own room and see if this is all
right.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, never tell a human soul how you
got it back. I have gone beyond my duty to get this
into your hands. I would be cast off the force, punished
and disgraced.”</p>

<p>The old lawyer heard Elaine Willoughby’s cry of
affright when Daly told her that Vreeland lay dead by
his own hand in the squalid trysting place of sin.</p>

<p>Hugh Conyers, with a fine prescience of some coming
tragedy, had held the boy messenger under his
own eye in the rooms where he sat guarding Justine
until her partner in crime should have been seized.</p>

<p>“Let no one know, not even him!” begged Daly.
“Let the world always think it to have been a suicide
induced by drink and overspeculation. I can cover
it all up.</p>

<p>“Your daughter is safe now. Trust to no one but
Conyers. Tell him the whole story, for, he loves the
very ground you walk on.”</p>

<p>There was a strange pallor on Elaine’s face as she
laid her finger on her lips.</p>

<p>“You have saved the happiness of three women,
their future, and their peace of heart and soul. Do
not stir. I must have time to think,” she whispered,
as she glided away.</p>

<p><a id="png.332" href="#png.332"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>330<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Murmuring, “Dead! dead! in all his unfinished
villainy!” she walked calmly back into the room where
the old lawyer awaited her final answer to Senator
Alynton’s urgent prayers.</p>

<p>“Go, my friend! Go! Bring Senator Alynton here
at once,” cried the desperate woman.</p>

<p>“In your presence only, I will return to him the
document which he demands. And its return marks
my divorce for life from the Street. I have signed my
last check for stocks, and my heart says Never Again!</p>

<p>“Go quickly; for when Romaine arrives I wish to
be only the Lady of Lakemere. I have stepped down
and out. I abdicate! There’s no longer a Queen of
the Street.</p>

<p>“Noel Endicott can close up all my affairs under
your directions.”</p>

<p>“And, Vreeland?” anxiously cried Judge Endicott.
The woman’s lips trembled. “I shall never see him
again,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Go now, for my strength fails, and I wish to be rid
of the dangerous trust forever—this terrible paper
which is lying a weight upon my heart.”</p>

<p>When the old advocate hastened away, then Elaine
Willoughby turned like a tigress at bay.</p>

<p>“Bring Conyers here. I must think! Think! You
may yet save us all!” The policeman darted away.</p>

<p>In five minutes, Daly had recounted the whole
story to Hugh Conyers, who sat holding the woman’s
trembling hands.</p>

<p>“I must go back now. Give me your orders. The
newspapers are all that I fear! We must outwit
them.”</p>

<p>“Is there not a French restaurant on the ground
floor of this haunt down there?” said Conyers.</p>

<p><a id="png.333" href="#png.333"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>331<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“Yes, yes!” impatiently cried Daly.</p>

<p>“Then,” calmly answered Hugh Conyers, “the
story goes as follows: Vreeland, after a hard-drinking
bout, had secretly wandered, half-mad, upstairs
and took his life in the first room found open.</p>

<p>“You will remove his body to the Elmleaf apartments.
I will send young Kelly down there to prepare
Bagley for the last visit of his master.”</p>

<p>“And must I notify the Coroner when the body is
there?” demanded the Roundsman, in admiration of
the plan.</p>

<p>“Yes, and tell your own story. Keep the deputy
marshals quiet. I’ll see that they are all well
rewarded. I will telephone down to the Wall Street
office that Mr. Vreeland has died by accident. I will
meet Maitland, Wyman and Noel Endicott at the
Elmleaf.</p>

<p>“One of them can go over and notify Vreeland’s
wife, and so, the whole thing rests safely in our hands.”</p>

<p>“Helms and Mulholland?” questioned Roundsman
Daly.</p>

<p>“Let them be safely locked up in Ludlow Street Jail,
separately. The poor letter-carrier will soon confess,
and he can be pardoned. He has only been a tool.
Helms can be allowed to leave the country. He will
never talk!</p>

<p>“And to-night, I will face Justine with Martha Wilmot,
and then have her whole confession.”</p>

<p>“That scoundrel, Doctor Alberg?” moodily demanded
Daly, as he moved to the door.</p>

<p>“He will never be heard of after the news of Vreeland’s
suicide is published. Let him slink away;
that will be the easiest way to get rid of him.”</p>

<p>When Daly had departed, Mrs. Willoughby clasped
<a id="png.334" href="#png.334"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>332<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>both Conyers’ hands in her trembling palms. The
grateful light in her eyes was shadowed with tears.</p>

<p>“You would save me, Hugh?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“All trouble, all annoyance, all sorrow,” said the
journalist, as he rose. “I must be busy now. See
no one. Speak to no one, and above all never tell
Endicott nor Alynton nor any single living soul the
baseness of the man who lies dead down there.”</p>

<p>“You are my saviour,” she murmured; “I will
obey; I have only one matter to close up with Senator
Alynton, and then, I am free,” she said with downcast
eyes.</p>

<p>As Conyers went sadly away, he moodily added:
“And that is to answer ‘Yes’ to his offer of his hand
and fortune.”</p>

<p>Hugh Conyers was absent, engaged in throwing the
mantle of charity about Vreeland’s sudden death,
when Senator Alynton was led into Elaine’s presence
by Judge Endicott.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of a few moments for the load
to be lifted from the woman’s agitated heart. “There
is no receipt needed,” gravely said Endicott.</p>

<p>“Of course the possession of such a paper is as
dangerous to friend as foe. I have no fears that any
one will ever call on Mrs. Willoughby for it again.”</p>

<p>Alynton gazed upon the troubled face of the woman
whose empire over his heart only grew more perfect
day by day.</p>

<p>“I must come to you at another time. Can I write?”
he murmured. And Elaine Willoughby bowed her
head in silence then, for his speaking eyes told the
story of a life’s hopes. He forebore, in sheer mercy,
to press his suit upon her now.</p>

<p>The great Senatorial millionaire gazed uneasily at
<a id="png.335" href="#png.335"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>333<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Endicott. “I heard a strange rumor down at the
Waldorf from young Wiltshire, about Vreeland’s individual
failure on the Street being announced.”</p>

<p>“Not another word, I beg, Senator,” hurriedly
said the old lawyer, courteously taking his arm.</p>

<p>“My client has been too sadly shocked,” and with
the promise of his own return in the evening, Endicott
led his captive away.</p>

<p>“Thank God! They know nothing as yet!” cried
the Lady of Lakemere, as she called Mary Kelly to
her side.</p>

<p>It seemed to the agitated woman that the iron jaws
of fate had closed just behind her, and in her grateful
heart she saw her only champion, Hugh Conyers—strong,
brave, true, silent and tender. Her loyal and
silent knight!</p>

<p>The words of honest Dan Daly came back to her
now. A rosy blush flamed upon her cheeks as she fled
away from the tender-hearted Mary Kelly’s watchful
eyes. “Some day he shall know all, he shall know
my whole heart.”</p>

<p>And when the telegraph messenger, just then arriving,
had departed, she fell back in a happy swoon of
delight, for she had read the words which filled her
with sweet surcease of sorrow:</p>

<p>“Coming Saturday; Touraine. Love from Sara and
Romaine.”</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when Justine Duprez’s
broken sobs concluded her last hastily constructed
tissue of lies. The schoolboy guard had inadvertently
yielded up to her the news of Harold Vreeland’s death
in a moment of youthful pride. And she was scheming
to free herself now of the inconvenient steel
<a id="png.336" href="#png.336"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>334<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>jewelry which had so broken her spirit. It was a
<i lang="fr">sauve qui peut</i>!</p>

<p>When faced by Conyers, with Martha Wilmot at his
side, in the presence of her sternly silent mistress,
Justine caught at the last straw. She knew all the
weaknesses of her mistress’ womanly heart.</p>

<p>“I know why poor Monsieur Vreeland killed
himself. He loved my mistress madly, and he
feared that the rich Senator Alynton was going
to marry her. He had bribed me to tell him all
about Senator Alynton’s visits and of the love-making.
He was surely half-mad when he married
that heartless woman.</p>

<p>“Poor Vreeland! He suffered from a hopeless
love! He feared that Alynton would marry my mistress,
and he feared, too, that he would then be discharged
from the Wall Street business.” Mrs. Willoughby was trembling in a silent rage.</p>

<p>She dared not face a new whirlwind of gossip, and
so, the sly Frenchwoman had saved herself.</p>

<p>“But, you stole your mistress’ letter and gave it to
him,” coldly broke in Conyers. He realized, too, that
the story of Senator Alynton’s love-making would desperately
compromise Mrs. Willoughby, and the maid
could easily poison the public mind.</p>

<p>“I did not!” stoutly ejaculated the lying Frenchwoman.
“Vreeland bribed the German doctor—that
cowardly scoundrel Alberg—to have this very woman
here steal the love-letter, and she secretly gave it to
Alberg, and then he gave it to Vreeland. They are
both liars!</p>

<p>“I was afraid of Vreeland. He threatened to have
me discharged,” sobbed Justine. “And I know that my
mistress was very near to loving him at one time.
<a id="png.337" href="#png.337"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>335<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The whole truth will come out at my trial. I am
innocent. I shall demand the aid of the French
Consul.” Conyers and Elaine shuddered at this
threat of noisy publicity.</p>

<p>“You met him at your rooms,” angrily broke in
Conyers, who now saw Elaine’s agony. The girl had
skillfully hidden her face in her hands. It was her
last chance.</p>

<p>“He paid me well for my trouble. I am poor, so
poor, and I was afraid that I might be accused of
stealing the letter. He himself spirited this lying
woman away. And I am to be sacrificed! The public
shall be my generous jury. I will tell the story to
the whole world. You dare not ruin me!”</p>

<p>Conyers’ eyes met his beloved one’s in an awkward
silence. Then he returned once more to the attack.
“There were the tell-tale wires and the criminal tapping
of the telegraph and telephone.” Conyers was
less harsh in his accusations now, for even Martha
Wilmot was appalled by the Frenchwoman’s audacity.
Justine Duprez felt firmer ground under her now.
Her glib answer was ready!</p>

<p>“Vreeland undoubtedly paid the letter-carrier and
the janitor. He was madly determined to prevent the
marriage with Alynton, at any cost. He knew that
the Senator disliked him, and would soon cast him
out. You can call those two men before me here. I
will face the whole world, and tell them how the poor
young man died for a love which he had been led
into. Why did my mistress pick him up? For a summer’s
amusement? The fine lady’s game. She drove
poor Hathorn to madness. And, she is, of course, a
fine lady!”</p>

<p>Hugh Conyers was called from the room, leaving
<a id="png.338" href="#png.338"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>336<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Elaine Willoughby trembling there, with her pale
cheeks tinged with a sudden flame.</p>

<p>There was no defense against this flood of vulgar
abuse. Her soul recoiled at the threatened publicity.
The sanctity of her heart was being violated by this
brutal traitress, now alert in the defense of her liberty.
And there were the dangerous secrets of the Sugar
ring to keep! She was now paying the price of her
own rashness.</p>

<p>Conyers soon returned, and led his beautiful charge
to the end of the room.</p>

<p>“Alberg has escaped!” he whispered. “He sailed
from Hoboken on a Norwegian tramp steamer to-day.
Daly reports that Helms and Mulholland have been
eagerly racing to confess.</p>

<p>“Mulholland blames the drink curse, and says that
Vreeland paid him to help steal a rival’s love-letters,
‘only to beat the game’ of that hated one. Helms
stubbornly stands out and swears that Vreeland bribed
the electrician to tap the wires so as to overhear
Mrs. Willoughby’s lawyer talking over the impending
marriage. So you see, the lying jade will have witnesses
to back up her story.”</p>

<p>“What must I do? Tell me, Hugh. You are my only
friend,” faltered Elaine, grasping his arm convulsively.
“There is my child. Think of the agony to her—the
shame of such disclosures! My new-found darling!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there are the newspaper scandals to fear—the
worst feature. We could not try these people
and dare to openly prove the real facts. Even a
French maid’s gossip and babble can find believers,”
sadly said Hugh, with averted eyes. He well knew
the callous gossips!</p>

<p>“You would only estrange Alynton, plunge your
<a id="png.339" href="#png.339"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>337<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>daughter into a useless sorrow, and your whole life story
would be bruited abroad. I can not bear to see you
disgraced, Elaine,” he faltered.</p>

<p>“I have a plan,” he said slowly. “Keep the woman
Justine here. I will pay her and ship her off to Paris.
Dan Daly will see that she goes. Let us only frighten
her! She will be only too glad to escape her rightful
punishment—the lying jade! You have recovered your
dangerous document. You do not need Martha Wilmot
now. Let me separate these people at once!</p>

<p>“Martha goes back first to England. Alberg is
gone, and of course the nurse can not be convicted.
There is no direct evidence. I will have Mulholland
quietly released; Daly can answer for him. Helms
we will call quits with, on his frankly signing a full
confession, naming only himself, and I give him a
passage over to Hamburg. And this will stop Justine’s
mouth forever.”</p>

<p>“And the disposition of Justine?” murmured the
white-faced woman.</p>

<p>“She stays here only till Vreeland is buried, and I
then will have her properly paid off before the Consul,
and see her on the French steamer myself. I know the
French Consul very well. She will never return. It
is the only way to bury the whole past in Vreeland’s
grave.</p>

<p>“For, only in this way, Daly can quietly aid me to
frighten a written confession out of each of our other
captives. And then the courts, newspapers and the
public must perforce remain out of the affair. I have
to go now and see Wyman and Endicott about the
arrangements for Vreeland’s funeral, as his widow
refuses to see any human being. That marriage was
only part of some abortive scheme, ruined by Garston’s
<a id="png.340" href="#png.340"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>338<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>death. I should say that you had seen enough of
Wall Street now.”</p>

<p>“Use full power, any money; let it be as you
wish,” said Elaine, leaving the room without a word
to the two women. “I trust you of all men!” she had
whispered at parting. And yet Conyers only sighed
wearily.</p>

<p>Conyers, adroitly separating the two culprits, hastened
to give his directions to Roundsman Daly, who
led away Martha Wilmot to begin her preparations for
a return voyage. He saw the cogency of Conyers’
smothering policy. “Best end for a bad job all
round,” said the blunt policeman.</p>

<p>It was midnight when Daly and Conyers finished
the details of the plan, which they quickly carried
out.</p>

<p>The new deal left only Justine Duprez, a moody, self-torturing
woman, lingering along under surveillance,
until she grasped at her safety by an implicit obedience.
She was now humbled and eager for departure.
She well knew that Vreeland’s grave hid her only
friend.</p>

<p>“Thank heaven, Daly!” said Conyers. “I have
‘squared’ all the reporters, you have done the same for
the police, and I think after the two men are buried,
that a week will find them both forgotten in the swim!
So runs the modern world away!”</p>

<p>“I am glad of the whole ending,” said honest Daly.
“For as Mrs. Willoughby has promised to give Mary
a home of her own, and she needs her services no more,
I shall soon ask you to my wedding, and, I also hope to
hear of your own.”</p>

<p>“You just go ahead and get married, Dan,” laughed
Conyers. “I have waited a good many years, and I
<a id="png.341" href="#png.341"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>339<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>am in no hurry. I belong to the great reading public,
my hydra-headed master! There is no place for love
in the study. Cupid is a poor penman.”</p>

<p>It was a fortunate matter that Senator Alynton was
busied for a week with the imposing obsequies of
James Garston, for, the private funeral of Harold
Vreeland was passed over with little remark by the
man who had been his enemy. Alynton had been
quieted by the return of the document, and now, no
troublesome heirs of Garston could ever unearth the
secret compact.</p>

<p>Overspeculation and the pace that kills, told the
whole story of Vreeland’s downfall, and a new golden
sign, “Wyman &amp; Endicott,” had replaced the last
public evidence of Vreeland’s meteoric rise and fall,
even before the sod rested upon the forgotten suicide.</p>

<p>Two black-robed women met at the side of Senator
James Garston’s coffin in a sad silence.</p>

<p>The face of neither was visible, and when the last
solemn words of public farewell were spoken, neither
dreamed that under the two impenetrable crape veils
were hidden the woman whom he had loved most, and
the woman who had once loved him, with all the
despair of a lost soul.</p>

<p>There is a mercy in the freezing silence of death
which often hides that which would only rend the
more hearts already strained to the snapping of the
last chord.</p>

<p>Only those cheerful young club men, Messrs. Wiltshire,
Rutherstone and Merriman, noted the proud
eminence of Mrs. Volney McMorris as guide, companion
and friend to the widowed ward of the dead Senator.
The duenna was a skeleton key of society, fitting easily
into every dead lock, and well oiled.</p>

<p><a id="png.342" href="#png.342"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>340<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“The little woman will have a great fortune,”
said Merriman. “I hear that Garston has left a half
of his wealth to her. It comes in very handy now,
for, poor Vreeland was struggling in the breakers.</p>

<p>“She will be a great catch in due time,” was the chorus,
and, when they separated, each gilded youth had
separately registered a vow to “make up” to Mrs. McMorris, and then to go in later for the golden prize,
when that black crape had softened to lilac, and afterward
in due time bleached out into cheerful white,
with here and there a touch of returning color.
And they all knew Katharine Norreys’ good points
by a personal experience of the last fleeting twelve
months.</p>

<p><i lang="la">Vae victis!</i> The defeated suicide was borne away to
an humble grave by a few of the men who had shared
his brief prosperity. The three watchful club men,
already secret rivals, were on hand, there to note, with
surprise, the absence of the widow, who was reported
to be “broken down by her guardian’s recent death”
and “unable to appear.” And so, in the last mournful
parade the star performer was absent. It was
voted a dull affair.</p>

<p>No one ever knew in “society” of the secret visit
made by Katharine Vreeland, under Hugh Conyers’
escort, to take a last look at the features of the man
who had “failed along the whole line of life,” after
all. The defeated “young Napoleon!” The Lochinvar
of the West! But the peace which he had never
known had settled upon Vreeland’s pallid face.</p>

<p>Conyers had gravely given Mrs. Vreeland a few
words of caution as to the late “envied of all his set.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, sir,”<!-- TN: closing quote invisible --> calmly said the marble-faced
woman. “I have buried his past forever, and your
<a id="png.343" href="#png.343"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>341<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>protecting counsels are not in vain; for, I unfortunately,
knew him as he was. I shall leave New York
forever, for, penniless as I am, I will have now to earn
my bitter daily bread, but at least in some other place
than here.”<!-- TN: closing quote invisible --></p>

<p>Conyers gazed wonderingly at her. “Did you not
know that Senator Garston has left you half his fortune?
You will be a rich woman. I have seen a certified
copy of the will.” And then the pale-faced
woman reeled at this last proof of a fidelity reaching
beyond the grave. Garston had been game to the core!</p>

<p>Conyers sprang to the side of the fainting woman,
who murmured, with trembling lips, “He loved me!
He loved me, at the last!”</p>

<p>With an infinite pity in his heart, Conyers gazed at
the broken-hearted lonely widow. “Here is some
strange new mystery,” he mused. “Thank God that it
is sacred from me.” And then he told her of all the
cautious actions of the Trust Company, which was now
only awaiting the arrival of Miss Romaine Garland for
the proper legal notifications. And so, the romance of
a sweet sin remained sealed from all hearts but the
one throbbing in Katharine Vreeland’s guilty bosom!</p>

<p>And thus in a week two young women who had never
met before in life listened, with grave lawyers at
their sides, to the publication of the formal news of an
equal division of Garston’s great fortune between a
now widowed ward, of whose past history the world
knew nothing, and Miss Romaine Garland, at whose
side Mrs. Elaine Willoughby, Judge Endicott and
Hugh Conyers sat as a loving bodyguard. Even the
“hardy reporter” was baffled by the guarded
solemnity of the Surrogate proceedings. Scandal
slept on its arms for once!</p>

<p><a id="png.344" href="#png.344"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>342<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Katharine Norreys Vreeland saw that the beautiful
stranger was robed in deep mourning like herself, and
she started back in surprise as the lovely face was
unveiled when Elaine Willoughby brought the two
heiresses together in a private room.</p>

<p>“It is only to you here that I will say,” solemnly
remarked the Lady of Lakemere, “that the settlement
of the estate business will not require you to
meet again. The Trust Company will properly close
up all the details, and your personal lawyers can
arrange all your affairs separately with them.</p>

<p>“I know,” she slowly said, with a broken voice,
“that Senator Garston left no personal wishes, and
that his trust for each of you was merely private and
a personal one. He had no near relatives to quarrel
with his final dispositions.”</p>

<p>“Can it be,” murmured Katharine Vreeland, “that
another life secret is buried in his pulseless heart?”</p>

<p>But she was soon left alone, for the mother and
daughter, with a grave inclination of their heads, had
passed out of her life forever.</p>

<p>And, thrilled with a strange feeling of loyalty to the
man who had been loyal to her at the last—the man
who had died true to the unspoken secret which a
kindly fate had so strangely guarded—Katharine
Vreeland never sought to cross the gulf of that new-made
grave.</p>

<p>That French Pandora Justine Duprez, had reached
Paris, and the reunited mother and daughter were
linked in a rapturous love at Lakemere, long before
Romaine Garland listened to a few words spoken to
her by the old advocate, who had undertaken her
affairs. He had sought her out in a lonely nook of the
new paradise.</p>

<p><a id="png.345" href="#png.345"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>343<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Judge Endicott, with a prophetic instinct, saw the
unrest which possessed the young girl’s heart. He
had a delicate duty to perform, to which his chivalric
love for Elaine Willoughby prompted him.</p>

<p>“I must, my dear young lady,” he began, eyeing<!-- TN" original reads "eying" --> her
face keenly, “deal with you directly and alone, in the
matter of your inheritance from the late Senator
Garston.</p>

<p>“Your beloved mother needs an absolute repose of
mind and nerves. I wish to lay a friendly charge
upon you.</p>

<p>“I will relieve you of all cares as to your affairs
with the Trust Company.</p>

<p>“Let it be your task to make your mother’s life as
bright as possible. She will learn to live a new life in
your love.”</p>

<p>And then, the silver-haired Judge delicately led the
dark-eyed girl along to imagine the shadow of an
old family tragedy as having darkened her mother’s
early lonely womanhood.</p>

<p>“There are reasons why you should spare all references
<span class="nw">to—”</span></p>

<p>“My father! my father!” cried the sobbing girl,
burying her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Endicott gazed at her in a pitying silence.</p>

<p>“The story of the estrangement of two partners and
your mysterious inheritance is one not fully known to
me, but you can cherish the memory of James Garston
as one faithful to the trust of a stormy past, whose
echoes I beg you never to awaken.</p>

<p>“Should your beloved mother marry Senator Alynton,
one of America’s noblest men, you would find his
counsels wise, his honored name a shelter, and your
<a id="png.346" href="#png.346"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>344<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>securely invested fortune, of course, now makes you
independent of all possible financial disaster.</p>

<p>“The same caution holds as to Mrs. Katharine
Vreeland, who has already left New York for a protracted
sojourn abroad.</p>

<p>“There are sorrows which are sacred. It rests with
you alone to bring back the happiness which she craves
to your mother’s sorely tried heart.” The old gentleman
paused, for the proud girl’s cheeks were glowing.</p>

<p>“Shall we be allies?” he simply said. “I have
served your mother, the noblest woman whom I ever
met, in loyalty for fifteen long years.” The grateful
girl smiled through her tears.</p>

<p>“There is my hand!” Romaine Garland cried. “I
see that you would have me understand why my
mother does not openly explain to society my different
name and my clouded childhood. You require my
silence as to the past.”</p>

<p>“Precisely, my dear young lady,” said the gallant
old lawyer, as he fled happily away. “I have plausibly
explained what I do not care to know myself, Conyers!”
remarked the Judge, next day, to the grave-faced
journalist. “But the whole thing will right
itself when Senator Alynton marries the mother. I
presume after her return from their trip abroad that
Elaine Willoughby will find her final heart-rest in a
good man’s love.”</p>

<p>But when Endicott had finished his cogitations he
was alone, for Hugh Conyers had hastily excused
himself on the plea of urgent business.</p>

<p>Endicott honestly believed that Garston had only
held back Romaine’s property to prevent a marriage
with Alynton.</p>

<p>Mr. James Potter, driving down the avenue a few
<a id="png.347" href="#png.347"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>345<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>days later, bowed with deep respect to Mrs. Elaine
Willoughby, who was passing, with her lovely daughter
seated by her side. He turned to his wife, whose
face was averted.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said he, “if that plunger Vreeland
really impaired her fortune. He was a most reckless
and insinuating scoundrel, and he diligently hunted
his punishment. He, however, saved the State the
trouble of keeping him in Sing Sing for a term of
years, for it would surely have come around to him.</p>

<p>“One-half the energy devoted to being an honest
man that he expended in his schemes would have
made him a colossal success.”</p>

<p>But the Lady of the Red Rose at his side only
sighed in a silent relief, for with a shudder she
recalled what a permanent guarantee of safety for
herself—for her past recklessness—lay in the immovable
seal of death affixed to Harold Vreeland’s pallid
lips.</p>

<p>And in the crowded “Street,” as well as in the
glittering booths of Vanity Fair, the light-headed men
and women hurrying on in pursuit of the iridescent
bubble Pleasure, or the Fool’s Gold, soon forgot that
a stealthy-eyed man of conquering mien had ever
come from the West to dazzle them for a moment.
“<i lang="fr">Étoile qui file et disparait!</i>”</p>

<p>In the dark waters of Lethe soon was ’whelmed the
memory of the man who had so miserably perished
in the “swim.”</p>

<p>The fleecy mantle of winter snows covered the
“eligibly located” mound in Greenwood, where a
marble cenotaph was soon to proudly record the many
virtues of James Garston, and the same pallid mantle
of charity hid the lonely mound in humbler Woodlawn
<a id="png.348" href="#png.348"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>346<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>where Harold Vreeland slept the sleep that knows
no waking.</p>

<p>He was already forgotten in the bustling Street,
where the new firm of “Wyman &amp; Endicott” was a
stately and established fact. “<i lang="fr">Le roi est mort! Vive
le roi.</i>”</p>

<p>By some subtle freemasonry of the guild of Midas,
the whole stock-dealing coterie soon knew that Mrs. Elaine Willoughby had doffed her crown as Queen of
the Street.</p>

<p>The iron reserve of her former secret agents was
never broken, and none knew and few cared whither
she had gone out of the maddening whirl and, whether
with full or empty coffers.</p>

<p>The social world knew, though, that the splendid
apartment at the “Circassia” was dismantled, and the
various society journals announced the impending
departure of the Lady of Lakemere “for a residence
abroad of some years.” Garston’s death had proved
a bombshell, scattering several little coteries.</p>

<p>Only old Hiram Endicott gravely shook his head at
the mysterious movements of his social friends. The
match-making prophecy seemed clouded.</p>

<p>Senator Alynton was busied dealing sturdy blows
in the Senate at his party’s foes, and beyond a final
conference arranging for the closing out of all past
relations of his fair client with the Sugar Syndicate,
Endicott followed neither the affairs of the giant
partnership in Gotham nor their secret allies in Washington.</p>

<p>He was busied with much legal detail in arranging
Mrs. Willoughby’s manifold affairs for a protracted
absence. “I wish all to be in order, Judge,” she
said, “for I know not what may happen, and
<a id="png.349" href="#png.349"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>347<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Romaine’s future must be assured.” The bright-faced
girl had simply stormed her loving mother’s
heart.</p>

<p>“There is only one way to assure it,” gravely
answered the old lawyer. “You must marry, for the
child’s sake. This past life of yours has been a
lonely, a wasteful and a forced one.</p>

<p>“Now that you are out of stocks forever, now that
you have found a new happiness in that charming
girl, it is for you alone to build a barrier for her
against the future fortune-hunter or scheming knave.</p>

<p>“There are more Hathorns and Vreelands in the
world than those two dead speculating lovers.”</p>

<p>“Whom would you have me marry?” asked Margaret
Cranstoun, gazing demurely at her chivalric friend—the
man who even now possessed but half her life
secret.</p>

<p>Her woman’s heart was now beating wildly with a
suggestion which she dared not own.</p>

<p>“Why, Alynton, of course! One of America’s most
brilliant men, a man already of national reputation,”
slowly rejoined the old lawyer.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes in a startled surprise as the
beautiful woman frankly said, with a merry laugh:</p>

<p>“I certainly can not consider his proposal—until
he makes it!”</p>

<p>She fled away, however, to confer with Noel Endicott
upon the final closing accounts of the banking
firm in which she was leaving a handsome sum as
“special partner.”</p>

<p>Both the Lady of Lakemere and the old Solon were
now playing at “hoodman blind.” And Hugh Conyers
felt himself of little use now, for the clouds had all
vanished. He was no fair-weather friend.</p>

<p><a id="png.350" href="#png.350"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>348<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>Elaine’s heart was light when she saw how completely
Endicott had deceived himself. “Fate is still
kind to me; no one knows, no one shall ever know,”
she murmured, locking up a fond woman’s secret in
her throbbing breast. It was not yet the appointed
time of the final surrender of her self-sovereignty.</p>

<p>There was merriment at Lakemere, where Sara
Conyers watched with a secret satisfaction the
increasing intimacy of Noel Endicott with the beautiful
girl who had so strangely drifted into a loving
mother’s arms.</p>

<p>For Noel came daily now, “on business”—the road
seemed to shorten every day with use—and the guest
chamber of Lakemere which he most affected was
his real headquarters. “There was so much to
arrange for the retirement of the queen.”</p>

<p>“I shall let Senator Alynton know privately of
Elaine’s projected absence,” wisely decided the
sagacious Judge Endicott. “He should have a fair
field,” and to this end the old lawyer counseled with
Hugh Conyers, now busy and preoccupied.</p>

<p>“There is a strong, able, wise man,” said Endicott.
“Just the man to make her a good husband!” The
Judge was astounded at Conyers’ complete indifference.</p>

<p>“I may go over to England soon on a long assignment,”
shortly said Hugh. “You might speak to my
sister. These are, after all, things for women’s
advice. I am no squire of dames. I think of giving
up active journalism now.”</p>

<p>Endicott then reflected that Hugh Conyers’ face
was rarely seen now in the happy coterie at Lakemere.
The delicate details of covering all of the tragic
past from Romaine Garland were all completed. “I
wonder what is the matter with him?” growled
<a id="png.351" href="#png.351"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>349<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Endicott. “I looked for his help to bring about this
marriage.”</p>

<p>Hugh’s last work had been to close up the “Elmleaf”
headquarters, and to direct Bagley, now the
head butler at Lakemere, in storing the scattered
effects of the unhappy suicide.</p>

<p>For Mrs. Katharine Norreys Vreeland had departed
for Europe, and, even the International Trust Company
refused to disclose her address or whereabouts.</p>

<p>Her private lawyer, Mr. Abel Hanford, of the
company’s legal staff, declined to accept the ownership
of the mementoes of the dead adventurer and
guarded a grim and sullen silence.</p>

<p>“I am positively ordered not to disturb my client,
who is in impaired health, with any references to the
late Mr. Vreeland or his affairs. Sell the trash, and
turn the money in to me. I will receipt for that!” It
was cold comfort.</p>

<p>And no further word would the cool young lawyer
utter, even to Horton Wyman, now anxious to legally
close up all the affairs of the defunct schemer.</p>

<p>“Turn the whole thing then over to the Public
Administrator!” was the counselor’s curt order.
“My client will not return to America for many years,
if ever.”</p>

<p>In all these strange happenings Miss Sara Conyers
was the only one at Lakemere who was really
unhappy at heart. She was the sole confidante of
Romaine Garland, who now poured out all her secret
conclusions upon the bosom of her faithful friend.</p>

<p>Romaine had seized upon Katharine Vreeland’s
departure as being the closing scene of the veiled
mystery of her unknown father’s life.</p>

<p>But a lucky accident helped the plans of the wise
<a id="png.352" href="#png.352"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>350<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>old Judge. “I am to bury the past and all reference
to it. There must have been some strange sorrow,
and perhaps my co-heiress was in the past a part of
some hostile element.”</p>

<p>Completely deceived as to her birth, the young girl
divided with Sara Conyers a budding mystery of
sweetness and light, which she dared not as yet
acknowledge upon her mother’s bosom. For the
Queen of the Street was a stately presence, and
Romaine’s maidenly heart was shy and gentle.</p>

<p>But Noel Endicott was daily becoming to her the
joy-bringer and his “business” at Lakemere was not
unseen by his astute old uncle.</p>

<p>“That goes on well enough!” the old lawyer
chuckled, “and it will be a noble ending to the poor
girl’s homeless childhood. But my lady herself is a
mystery.” He forgot to add, “as all other women
are,”—the same changeful mystery.</p>

<p>“She has locked up her heart and seems to be still
determined to walk the lonely path. If Alynton
would only speak!” The old Judge fretted and
fumed among his parchments.</p>

<p>Loyal Sara Conyers alone, knew why her brother
Hugh had studiously avoided the happy circle at
Lakemere.</p>

<p>For old Judge Endicott’s prophetic words as to
Alynton’s wooing rankled deep in the steadfast
man’s lonely heart. He waited grimly and afar off
for the advent of the conquering swain, Senator
Alynton.</p>

<p>“She needs me no more,” he bitterly decided. “It
is all over. I have the whole world to choose from
for a future home, and as she seems to have captured
Sara for life, I am now free to go my way.”</p>

<p><a id="png.353" href="#png.353"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>351<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>And so, when the foreign station was offered him,
Conyers quietly accepted it, and then leisurely prepared
for his departure.</p>

<p>In daily close communion with Hugh Conyers’
sister, the Lady of Lakemere silently wondered at his
continued absence and pondered over the gravely
worded letters of polite refusal which answered her
hospitable biddings.</p>

<p>There was that strange, sweet womanly pride in
Elaine Willoughby’s heart, the pride of a cherished
secret, which held her speechless when the words of
inquiry trembled on her lips. And it seemed as if the
witching breath of the tender spring, hinting of
summer roses, had now bewitched the whole circle.
The fern seed of invisibility drifted down on all the
hidden plans slowly revolving around Lakemere.
For the long winter had worn away, and the time of
the singing of birds had come again.</p>

<p>Elaine Willoughby, hugging her undiscovered secret
with a lingering pleasure, ardently sighed for the
days when safe beyond the reach of all untoward
accident, she could build up around her recovered
daughter the paradise of a happy home beyond the
seas. Of herself, of her own future, she dared not to
think, for the sweet spring was stirring in her throbbing<!-- TN: original reads "throbing" -->
pulses.</p>

<p>“She will learn, she must learn, in my tenderest
love, to forget that unasked question of her brooding
eyes—‘My father!’<!-- TN: original uses double quotes --> It is better that she never knows—best
for us all.” This task of induced forgetfulness
was the mother’s single ambition now.</p>

<p>The arrangements for departure were rapidly progressing,
and as the time of roses came nearer, Elaine
<a id="png.354" href="#png.354"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>352<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>could not disguise her increasing restlessness in noting
Hugh Conyers’ absence.</p>

<p>The saddened eyes of his sister brought a sudden
alarm to Elaine’s heart.</p>

<p>For a pride as strong as her own had kept them
tenderly apart.</p>

<p>The modest household of Roundsman Dan Daly
had been enriched with all the splendors removed
from the Elmleaf, and Mary Daly daily blessed the
generous hand which had given to her the home in
which the very spirit of happiness seemed to have
nestled.</p>

<p>And only there, in that modest home, of all the
circle, was there peace and rest, for both the mother
and daughter at Lakemere, in tender deceit, guarded
the heart secrets which they dared not own.</p>

<p>The silent resentment of Sara Conyers against the
self-banishment of her brother was now growing into a
doubt of Elaine Willoughby’s womanly gratitude.</p>

<p>“Between her and Hugh I have no choice,” the
angered womanly champion of an absent brother
decided. “Back to our old eyrie we go together, or
else, I will share Hugh’s foreign exile.” And she
marveled at her brother’s imperative injunction of
silence as to his plans.</p>

<p>It was when Noel Endicott was feverishly closing
up the last final “business affairs” at Lakemere,
supplemented with some portentously long “personal
conferences” with that young Diana, Miss Romaine
Garland, that Judge Endicott, a grave embassador,
came up to Lakemere with news of serious moment.
He was secretly Cupid’s embassador.</p>

<p>He was alone with the woman whose interests he
had chivalrously guarded for fifteen long years.
<a id="png.355" href="#png.355"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>353<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>With a sigh he returned again to the question of the
marriage—the strange dead-lock which had so baffled
him.</p>

<p>“You sail for Europe in a month. Have you nothing
to say to me, Elaine? There is but one final seal
to the happiness of your future life. Your marriage.”</p>

<p>“The Senator has an ardent advocate, my dear
old friend!” Elaine answered, with beaming eyes, “but
he has not yet asked for me!”</p>

<p>“He will,” very decidedly answered Endicott. “I
have a letter, in which he asks me to arrange an
interview, to formally ask your permission to come
here.</p>

<p>“I now understand the delicacy which has held him
back till all your momentous business matters have
been settled and you have been relieved from all the
awkwardness of your confidential relations with the
two great bands of capitalists.</p>

<p>“He has respected your illness, your agitation over
Garston’s mysterious death, and has given you time
to arrange all your legal affairs and settle Romaine’s
inheritance.</p>

<p>“Remember, he deems her to be only your ward.</p>

<p>“They speak now of Alynton for a leading Cabinet
position. His term in the Senate is expiring; or they
will give him one of the four Embassies.</p>

<p>“If he asks you to share his life, I would say nothing
to him of the unhappy past. Romaine is now of
age. She is rich beyond need. I myself never have
questioned you.</p>

<p>“You have a right to hold back all that might
shadow Romaine (God bless her!) in her possible
future marriage.”</p>

<p>Endicott’s voice was tremblingly affectionate, and
<a id="png.356" href="#png.356"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>354<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>yet the solicitude was tinged with a solemn earnestness.</p>

<p>The old lawyer rose and kissed the fair woman’s
hand. “My life-work is nearly done. Noel, as your
agent, can carry on the executive affairs, and as you
are off the ‘Street’ and out of stocks forever, you
will need no lawyer, only now and then a mere bit of
office counsel, and therefore I am turning over my
practice soon to Headley, my partner and legal
disciple. He will be to you what I have been.
Alynton will call within two days.”</p>

<p>“You wish me to marry?” said Elaine, with softly
shining eyes. “Wait, wait! I may consider your
advice and act favorably upon it.” The happy old
advocate departed, sure of his victory. It was all
going on well.</p>

<p>Hiram Endicott was haunted by the strange smile
which lit up the thoughtful face of the woman whose
life as Margaret Cranstoun was now closed forever
from a curious world by the sealed barriers of a dead
past.</p>

<p>“She will surely accept him,” rejoicingly muttered
the happy old advocate. “Noel will then gain
Romaine’s heart, and there will be a royal circle
gathered in coming years at Lakemere, around the
once lonely fireside.” But, Love that hath us in the
net was weaving, ever weaving, in silence.</p>

<p>And the cross purposes of the unwitting actors were
seemingly as unsolved as before. With a sudden
craving for aid in her hour of mental indecision, that
night Elaine Willoughby wrote a last appeal to the
invisible Hugh Conyers:</p>

<p>“I must see you, Hugh, at once on a matter involving
the happiness of my whole future life. Come to
<a id="png.357" href="#png.357"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>355<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>me. I have no one but you to depend upon in this
vitally important juncture.”</p>

<p>As the Lady of Lakemere mentioned to her now
all-potent representative, Sara Conyers, the impending
visit of Senator David Alynton, she saw, with a
womanly intuition, an indignant flash of unspoken
resentment in her friend’s eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly forgetting her usually affectionate “Good-night,”
the startled hostess fled away to her own room,
and not daring to look at her own face in the mirror,
seized the letter directed to the recalcitrant Hugh
and tore it into little fragments.</p>

<p>“I understand!” she whispered with self-accusing
timidity, and now strangely fearful of her own judgment,
her heart leaping up in defense of the absent
man. “It would be too cruel! I dare not, and yet
how will he ever know?” Dan Cupid, from rosy
clouds, smiled roguishly upon her slumbers that night.</p>

<p>The brooding peace of Lakemere was left undisturbed
by the lively heiress and Miss Sara Conyers,
who had managed to have “sudden business” in the
city during the formal visit of Senator Alynton.</p>

<p>And so there was no one to see the proud man go
forth with a man’s saddest burden in his heart. She
loved another!</p>

<p>No one of the obsequious attendants saw a graver
shade than ordinary settle down upon the face of the
statesman when he turned his stately head at the park
gates in a last adieu to the graceful woman who stood
with her earnest eyes following his departing form.</p>

<p>“God bless her now and always!” the saddened
suitor murmured, even in his heart’s sorrow.</p>

<p>The noble simplicity of Alynton’s tender of his
hand, the tribute laid at her feet of a choice between
<a id="png.358" href="#png.358"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>356<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>the honors of the Cabinet and a foreign place of splendid
precedence—the manly words in which he told her
of his grave solicitude for her happiness, and the real
reasons for his past reticence, all had touched her
heart with a womanly pride in this man’s honest love.</p>

<p>“I could not tell him the whole truth, for the child’s
sake; and, less than the whole truth, would be an outrage
to his faith and a blot upon my womanhood.”</p>

<p>Judge Endicott now followed her with mute accusing
eyes, for he feared the ruin of his hopes.</p>

<p>It was a week before Romaine Garland’s head
sought her friend’s bosom.</p>

<p>“Sara,” she whispered, “do you know that we sail
next week? Your brother must come and say adieu,
for it is more than she can bear. I have a secret to
tell you. I need your help. I need his friendship.
Only Hugh can help me with my mother, for this
parting from Noel is almost death to me. She must
know the truth, but how?”</p>

<p>The elder woman raised the loving girl’s glowing
face to her own and fondly kissed her trembling lips:</p>

<p>“Ah! this is an easy task for you! I can guess your
secret, darling,” Sara sadly said. “But, I am going
away to share Hugh’s lot.</p>

<p>“I do not sail to Europe with you. I have not yet
told your dear mother.</p>

<p>“For she will know it soon enough, and then over
there, beyond the sea, you will live in new scenes,
with other friends to share your happy hours. You
will be soon called back—there, don’t deny it.</p>

<p>“And your mother—who would not love her?”
The blushing girl was seized with a sudden impulse,
love’s chords were thrilling in her heart.</p>

<p>It was on that very afternoon that Miss Romaine
<a id="png.359" href="#png.359"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>357<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Garland drove resolutely to the station and indited a
telegram which brought Hugh Conyers promptly to
the door of Lakemere, as the setting sun was dropping
behind the western hills of the Highlands. He
feared the very worst; some sudden disaster.</p>

<p>The mystified face of his loving sister at once
undeceived the man whose heart had been so
strangely stirred by Miss Mischief’s imperative dispatch.
For, the Silent Knight had “reported for
duty.” It was a lovingly set trap.</p>

<p>“Nothing has really happened?” he asked, with a
fear of some reserved news of unwelcome portent.</p>

<p>“Nothing, sir,” said Elaine Willoughby, quietly,
as she suddenly appeared before him, bringing a
quick thrill to his heart, “but that you are now under
arrest as a deserter, and so will have to stand a formal
court-martial.”</p>

<p>It was a second strategic movement on the part of
Romaine Garland, that summons of her lark-like voice
calling Sara Conyers to some consultation of truly
feminine gravity, in the distant seclusion of her own
rooms. “Miss Mischief” was <i lang="fr">en suprême<!-- TN: original reads "suprème" --></i>.</p>

<p>And there, side by side, Elaine Willoughby and
Conyers wandered away over to the summer-house,
where the first roses were breathing out their promise
of summer’s royal richness upon the fresh crystalline
air. Neither seemed willing to break the silence
of their hushed hearts.</p>

<p>“You sent for me, Elaine?” said the man, who
hardly dared to trust the sound of his own voice. It
seemed to him so strange and hollow.</p>

<p>His hostess turned her splendid eyes toward him,
and their hands met in silence.</p>

<p>“I did not, Hugh,” she softly said. “But as I will
<a id="png.360" href="#png.360"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>358<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>be away for some years, I thank God that you are
here! For, I have a sacred duty to perform.</p>

<p>“I know not what may happen.</p>

<p>“Sara has just told me that she will not go to
Europe with me. All seems so changed! Endicott is
growing old. I have no other friend, and I am
solicitous about Romaine’s future. I did intend to
ask you to act for me in some very grave matters, but
you have lately avoided me—strangely, cruelly.”</p>

<p>The voice was broken now, and Hugh Conyers
hastened to man his last works.</p>

<p>He knew now how love had sealed her proud,
womanly lips, for her heart was beating with his own.</p>

<p>“How could I come to you? If Sara had only saved
me this last sorrow! When I heard from Endicott
that you were to marry Alynton, I at once accepted
an engagement for five years to represent the <cite>Clarion</cite>
in Europe.</p>

<p>“I sail myself in a few weeks. I only waited for
your departure to have my sister select our little
household gods.</p>

<p>“For I have sworn to be a slave of the lamp no
more, and so my spinning is done. I shall not return
to America.”</p>

<p>“Do not leave me, Hugh!” murmured Elaine
Willoughby. “I need your friendship; I need you
more than ever, now <span class="nw">that—”</span></p>

<p>He was already striding away, for with a last convulsive
grasp of her hands, he had swiftly passed on
over the velvety turf toward the still opened gates.</p>

<p>His heart was in a mad revolt, there had been some
meddling folly, and his pulses were throbbing now
in a wild unrest. The agony was beyond his surface
stoicism.</p>

<p><a id="png.361" href="#png.361"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>359<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>But, he stood as one transfixed when a voice sweet
and low set his blood leaping madly through his veins.</p>

<p>“Hugh, come back!” The words were simple, but
he turned to where the woman whom he madly loved
stood awaiting him with half-outstretched arms.</p>

<p>“Do you not see?” she murmured. “How can I
tell you what you should have known long ago?”</p>

<p>“You are not to marry Alynton?” cried her lover, a
light of hope stealing into his eyes. His heart was
flooded with a warmth of daring hopes.</p>

<p>“The man whom I am to marry has not yet asked
me to be his wife,” faintly said Elaine.</p>

<p>“It was only Judge Endicott’s foolish solicitude
for my future.</p>

<p>“He may have told you what his own hopes or
wishes were, but only in the simple faith of a prophet
before his time.”</p>

<p>“It has been a hell on earth these long months,”
was Hugh’s response; “and I dared not to hope—I
did not <span class="nw">know—”</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="qt">“How weak and fond we women wait</div>
<div>Behind our silken <span class="nw">armor—”</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">whispered the splendid woman whose hand he had
covered with burning kisses.</p>

<p>“I have loved you, have worshiped you, and
have served you in perfect faith and truth since first I
saw your dear face,” was Hugh Conyers’ confession
of faith. She was gently paltering with her rebellious
heart. She would bring herself to the lines of a
clearly defined duty now.</p>

<p>“I must tell you to-night the story of a life. I
must swear you to secrecy, my Hugh,” faltered
Margaret Cranstoun.</p>

<p><a id="png.362" href="#png.362"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>360<span class="ns">]<br
 ></span></span></a>“For the child’s sake, you alone must know every
throbbing of my heart!”</p>

<p>He bowed his head in token of that fealty of the
soul which she longed for.</p>

<p>“You shall be the queen to the very end, my
darling!” he said. “I will lend you Sara,” he simply
said. “Take Romaine and her, and I will join you
by Lake Malar.</p>

<p>“I will at first report at London, and then, they
can name a man to relieve me.</p>

<p>“It will be the best plan, for our quiet marriage
over there, will arouse no comment here.</p>

<p>“The gold fish in the swim will not pause to wonder,
for their own reflections on the shallow water of
the pool of Fashion fill their delighted eyes.”</p>

<p>And so, they walked back, hand in hand, their
hearts throbbing together in Love’s royal bondage.</p>

<p>A week later, Judge Endicott stood upon the deck of
the Campania, waiting to give his last greetings to the
Lady of Lakemere, whose wonderful cheerfulness now
boded some new springing impulse of her happy
heart.</p>

<p>The old advocate eyed Hugh Conyers and his sister
with a pleading for the confirmation of his cherished
hopes. There seemed to be a happy secret linking
the three travelers in a golden bond. Was Alynton’s
life to be crowned at last?</p>

<p>And the silver-haired Judge, with a secret joy,
observed Noel Endicott’s tall form bending over Miss
Romaine Garland, whose hands were filled with those
June roses which are the very daintiest seals of
Cupid’s pledges.</p>

<p>In the last moments there was vouchsafed to him
the answer to the unspoken question which was
<a id="png.363" href="#png.363"><span class="pagenum x-ebookmaker-drop"><span
 class="ns">[</span>361<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>lingering on his lips, “the long-hoped-for marriage.”</p>

<p>“I am to be married, as you advised, my dear and
faithful friend,” was the parting confession of the
Lady of Lakemere.</p>

<p>“When?” demanded the delighted lawyer, as his
mind reverted to the vast advantages of Senator
Alynton’s friendship for his favorite nephew.</p>

<p>“Whenever Hugh calls upon me,” was Elaine’s
reply, as she felt her lover’s strong grasp of an already
imprisoned hand.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul! I have been blind!” cried the
happy old advocate.</p>

<p>“So, have we all been too long, Judge!” Hugh
Conyers gaily answered.</p>

<p>There was a little scene “not down on the bills” in
the shady corner, where Romaine Garland slipped a
sparkling ring upon her finger, when Noel Endicott
kissed her trembling lips.</p>

<p>“I will tell them as soon as we are at Stockholm,
and cable to you ‘Come,’” was the maiden’s pledge.</p>

<p>The uncle wondered at his nephew’s loyal vigil until
the stately ship was lost to sight far down the beautiful
bay.</p>

<p>And so, Love reigned upon the darkling waters that
happy night.</p>
